Summary of events of June 16, 1997:

Severe thunderstorms developed and moved across much of Oklahoma during the afternoon and evening of the 16th.  Numerous reports of large hail, damaging thunderstorm winds, and flash flooding were received from across the region.  

The largest hail fell east of Seminole in Seminole County, where grapefruit-sized hail was reported. Elsewhere, a combination of strong winds and hail as large as golf balls caused extensive damage in Tonkawa in Kay County and across much of Grant County.

The strongest estimated wind speed during the event was 80 mph in Comanche in Stephens County, which suffered widespread tree, limb, and structural damage.  Other major structural damage was reported in Kingston in Marshall County, northeast of Eldorado and in Altus in Jackson County, northwest of Hydro in Blaine County, in Seminole in Seminole County, and in Duncan in Stephens County.  More minor damage, mainly to trees and utility poles, occurred in Sayre and Elk City in Beckham County, in Marietta in Love County, in Arapaho and west of Custer City in Custer County, in Mannsville in Johnston County, east of Holdenville in Hughes County, in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County, in Marlow in Stephens County, and in Wewoka in Seminole County.  

Flash flooding was particularly severe in Ponca City in Kay County, where several people were rescued from flooded vehicles and seven homes were flooded.  Flash flooding was also reported in Gerty in Hughes County and in and around Comanche in Stephens County.

A long line of thunderstorms moved east across most of western and central Oklahoma during the early morning of the 5th resulting in widespread straight-line damage and 5 tornadoes. Severe thunderstorms first developed in Magnum in Greer County where large tree limbs were blown down. In Woods County trees were downed 12 miles west of Alva near the intersection of Highway 64 and Highway 14. In addition, power poles were snapped; house roofs and barns were damaged, and sheds were blown over. Power lines were also downed 7 miles west of Alva. In Washita County many house roofs were damaged in Dill City, and power lines were downed 5 miles southwest of Dill City. In Woodward County large tree limbs were downed in Belva, while in Mooreland a camper trailer was destroyed; fences and tree limbs were blown down, and numerous vehicles were damaged.
 
A survey conducted by the National Weather Service concluded that an F1 tornado touched down 6 miles west-southwest of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and tracked northeast for 7 miles before dissipating about 4 miles north of Cherokee. Two hay storage barns and another storage barn at a feedlot were destroyed, and a large irrigation system was destroyed. Also in Alfalfa County a haybarn was destroyed in Ingersoll; the roof was ripped off of a boat house, and another house received minor roof damage. Large power poles were blown down 5 miles northeast of Cherokee, and a barn was blown down in Amorita, also in Alfalfa County. Another tornado was confirmed by a National Weather Service survey 4 miles north-northeast of Ames in Major County. This tornado, rated an F0, touched down in an open field with no known damage. The same thunderstorm that produced this tornado was also responsible for straight-line winds which blew a moving vehicle off the road 4 miles north of Ames. 

A tornado also developed 2 miles north of Carrier in Garfield County, but no damage (F0) was observed as it touched down briefly in an open field. Another tornado, 3rd of the day, touched down about 8 miles south-southwest of Wakita in Garfield County and tracked northeast to about 5 miles south of Wakita. One sheet metal/wood frame hay storage barn was destroyed, and another was damaged. A truck was damaged, and tree limbs were blown down. The weak nature of the structures damaged or destroyed by this tornado warranted an F0 intensity rating. In addition to the tornado damage in Garfield County, straight-line wind damage was observed 2 miles north of Carrier where road signs were blown over, 7 miles south of Wakita where a shed was destroyed; a barn was blown over; a truck was damaged, and a few homes suffered roof and window damage, and 12 miles northwest of Medford where a semi was blown over, while in Grant County straight-line winds blew down power lines 6 miles west of Wakita.

As the line of thunderstorms continued to move east across portions of central Oklahoma, another tornado, an F1, developed in McClain County about 1 mile south of the intersection of Highway 59 and Highway 39, and moved northeast for 3 miles before dissipating. The most significant damage occurred near the intersection of Highway 39 and Youth Camp Road where the roof of a medium-sized house was severely damaged; 2 barns were destroyed, and a travel trailer was blown over onto a nearby car. In Pottowatomie County 1 mile southwest of McLoud a gazebo was destroyed, and a metal barn was damaged. Large tree limbs and a chainlink fence were also blown down, while in Wynnewood in Garvin County a barn was destroyed, and the roof of a horse barn was blown off; numerous trees and power poles were downed, and many homes received minor roof and structural damage. Severe thunderstorm winds also damaged a hangar and aircraft at the Ardmore Regional Airport in Ardmore in Carter County, while widespread damage occurred in Holdenville in Hughes County. Three homes received major damage, while 143 other homes received minor damage. Trees, power lines, and a radio tower were blown down, and at least one vehicle was damaged.",368433

With a strong high pressure system extending from north of New England southwest across the Great Lakes, a low pressure system formed off the Southeast Coast during Thursday, November 6th.  The low slowly intensified as it moved very slowly north off the Mid-Atlantic Coast Friday and Saturday.  It did not pass north of the area until Sunday, November 9th.

The heaviest rain fell during Saturday morning and afternoon on November 8th.  Generally 1 to 2 inches of rain fell across the area.  However, specific amounts ranged from 0.66 inches at Bridgehampton (Suffolk County) to 2.65 inches at Montgomery (Orange County). Minor flooding of low-lying poor drainage areas occurred where leafs clogged drains.

Northeast gales developed over the coastal waters after 7 am Friday, November 7th and lasted until around 8 am on Saturday, November 8th.  Seas peaked at 12 to 15 feet from 10 am on Friday through 10 am on Saturday.

Northeast winds gusted from 30 to 40 mph.  The highest peak gust was 44 mph at LaGuardia Airport on Friday, November 7th and 47 mph on Saturday, November 8th.

Summary of events for May 24-25 1998:

Many severe thunderstorms affected northern Oklahoma during the evening of May 24 and the early morning of May 25.  On the evening of May 24, the first thunderstorms moved south of the Kansas state line after 900 PM CDT.  After that, individual thunderstorms kept moving along a quasi-stationary front near the Oklahoma/Kansas border, causing one thunderstorm after another to move over the same areas just south of the Kansas state line.  One result was widespread rainfall amounts in excess of one inch with a storm total of 3.68 inches reported 8 ESE of Foraker and several unoffical reports of about 4 inches.  These storms were also prolific wind producers with thunderstorm gusts of 60 to 70 miles an hour common across the northern border counties.  Additionally, there were reports of a tornado touchdown north of Pawhuska and hail as large as quarters.  After 1100 PM CDT, the last in the series of storms took a more southward route across Rogers, Mayes, and Delaware Counties, producing severe winds and hail as large as golfballs, before exiting into Benton County AR around 300 AM CDT.  

Around 200 AM CDT, more severe thunderstorms developed in northwest Oklahoma and moved east along an outflow boundary produced by the earlier thunderstorms.  These storms moved across Pawnee and Tulsa Counties between 430 AM and 630 AM CDT, producing marginally severe hail and winds.  These storms weakened below severe levels as they moved past Tulsa County.

Although storm damage was reported from the Connecticut Valley region to the Worcester Hills and Merrimack Valley, damage was especially severe in eastern Franklin County as well as Boston's North Shore.

Early in the afternoon, one cluster of thunderstorms formed in Franklin County and rapidly became severe, causing considerable damage in Montague and especially Wendell.

A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service concluded the damage in Wendell was caused by a combination of straight-line wind damage and a tornado, which was rated as a strong F2 on the Fujita Scale with winds estimated near 155 mph.

Damage began around 230 pm EDT, about 200 yards west of Montague Road. Wind damage extended from Montague Road about 1.5 miles east to Wicket Pond in the Wendell State Forest. Large oak, maple, and pine trees were uprooted and snapped in this area. Some oaks over two feet in diameter were snapped about 10 to 15 feet from the ground. Damage from this microburst extended along a path of one and a half miles in length, and anywhere from 50 to 300 yards in width. Wind speeds were estimated near 90 mph.

Tornado damage first appeared on the northeast corner of Wicket Pond. An eyewitness reported seeing a six foot wave form on the pond. On the west side of the pond, many trees were snapped 15 to 20 feet above the ground, with debris left in a chaotic pattern.

The next area of damage was on Wicket Pond Road, which is where the most severe damage occurred. Trees as large as 3 feet in diameter were uprooted. Bark was stripped off trees and a house had part of its roof torn off. The tornado tracked to the east along Wicket Pond Road, passing over Depot Road which is in Wendell Center. Part of a roof was torn off an old barn and many trees were uprooted.

After crossing Depot Road, the tornado continued to track to the east, passing north of Morse Village Road. A construction storage trailer was completely destroyed and its roof was wrapped around a tree. Trees were also uprooted or snapped in this area. Damage came to an end about one half mile east of New Salem Road.

The path length of the tornado was approximately 3 miles. Its average width was 200 yards, varying from 100 to 300 yards.

A little more than one hour later, another cluster of severe thunderstorms brought significant damage to Cape Ann, in particular Marblehead Neck and the adjacent coastal waters. Initially, the storms produced hail as large as 3 inches in diameter - just larger than baseball size - which are considered to be the second largest hailstones reported in Massachusetts.

A National Weather Service storm survey concluded that multiple wet microbursts, or sudden outflow of damaging straight-line winds combined with torrential rainfall, impacted the area around Marblehead Neck between 357 pm and 430 pm EDT. The survey noted that westerly winds gusting as high as 90 mph occurred in an area centered from Marblehead Harbor across Corinthian Lane and Barker Lane, and then out to sea. The land damage path was short, primarily because the land is only about 700 feet wide in that area.

The main damage path was about 150 feet wide. It consisted of tree damage and minor structural damage, although substantial damage was noted to sailing vessels and at least one car. Damage was more sporadic near Manley Street, about 600 feet farther north, and also to the south and southwest on Foster Street, Harbor Avenue, and Ocean Avenue.

Interviews with eyewitnesses provide more detail as to how the storms affected the area. Between 340 pm and 345 pm EDT, winds shifted to the northeast and produced sea spray at the mouth of Marblehead Harbor. This was the result of earlier thunderstorms passing north of the area. Then, from 357 pm to 405 pm EDT, a white tempest developed over Marblehead Harbor on the neck side of the harbor, estimated by the Corinthian Yacht Club chair to be about 300 yards upstream from the dock. This curtain of water and high winds advanced toward the yacht club, lifting 30-foot vessels approximately 20 feet in the air and catapulting them end over end toward the dock. An anemometer on the dock was viewed to have reached 95 mph before it blew off its mast. 

Damage was less severe, but still significant, from the Connecticut Valley to the Worcester Hills and Merrimack Valley. There were many reports of downed trees, large branches, and hail up to the size of quarters from the Springfield area to Grafton, Westborough, and Framingham as well as farther northeast into Hardwick, Wilmington, and Boxford.

Torrential rainfall caused significant urban flooding, especially in Springfield, Oxford, Wakefield, and Beverly. In Salem, two cars on Pope Street were submerged by up to 3 feet of water when about 2 inches of rain fell in 20 minutes. Other cars were flooded in Salem and Lynn due to other roads being flooded, including a stretch of Route 129.

By and large, most of these storms affected areas near and south of Interstate 80. The first round flared up very early on the 21st, around midnight, reached peak intensity during the pre-dawn hours, and was largely out of the area by sunrise. This cluster of storms formed to the north of a nearly stationary east-west surface front stretched across Northern Kansas, within the nose of a 40-50 knot low level jet. The synoptic environment also featured at least 40 knots of deep layer shear, and MUCAPE values of 2000-3000 J/kg. For being so early in the morning, these storms were efficient damaging wind-producers near the Highway 6 corridor, with gusts to at least 70 MPH reported in parts of Phelps, Kearney and Adams Counties. In addition to damaging winds, there were also a few reports of hail, with hail up to golf ball size reported in Kearney County.

Following a break in the action that lasted most of the day and into the evening hours, another complex of severe thunderstorms started pushing into western sections of South Central Nebraska shortly after sunset, rolling through areas near and south of Interstate 80 during the next several hours, and lasting into the early morning hours on the 22nd. The synoptic situation was very similar to the first round of storms, with the same, quasi-stationary surface front hanging across Northern Kansas, 2000-3000 J/kg MUCAPE, and the nose of a 30-40 knot low level jet focused into the area. In similar fashion, these storms were primarily damaging wind-producers, with a corridor of reports of 60-75 MPH wind and associated damage centered from Harlan and Franklin Counties, east-northeast into Hamilton and Fillmore Counties.

A major severe weather outbreak occurred across western and central Oklahoma from the afternoon of the 4th through the early morning of the 5th, resulting in 19 tornadoes, straight-line wind damage, hail as large as baseballs, and significant flooding across portions of Lincoln and Noble Counties, where numerous costly bridges were destroyed.

Thunderstorms first developed over northwest Oklahoma during the early and mid-afternoon where hail larger than golf balls was reported in Major and Woodward Counties. The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).

Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.

While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.

The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. 

The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  

Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.

Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.

The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.     
  
The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.
      
Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.

The snow depth in Fargo on the 14th was 15 inches with a melted water equivalent of 3.10 inches. By the 17th, the snow depth in Fargo had dropped to 6 inches. This was followed by a couple of cooler days, which temporarily slowed down any additional snowmelt. A second period of warmer weather began on March 20th and continued through the 24th. During this period of time, high temperatures again climbed into the 40s and low 50s. Most of the remaining snow in Fargo melted during this stretch of warm weather, with the Fargo snow depth falling from 2 inches to 0. Conditions were about the same in Grand Forks, with the snow depth falling to 0 by the 24th. These two warmups resulted in a quick response in river levels, especially across the southern Red River Valley and west central Minnesota. The mainstem Red River also showed a response, especially in the southern Red River Valley. With all the runoff moving into the river systems, water covered many roads and resulted in numerous road closures. The water covered entire sections of land as well and threatened many homes. A winter storm event on March 24th and 25th brought more snow to the region, along with a turn to colder temperatures. This resulted in a first crest for many rivers in the southern Red River Valley and west central Minnesota. However, river levels at most points along the mainstem Red River continued to stay high. Another winter storm event hit much of the area March 30th to 31st, dropping up to 2 feet of snow in the southern Red River Valley. There was a lot of moisture in this new snow, with snow to liquid ratios of less than 10 to 1. This set the stage for continued flooding into the month of April.

Most creeks and streams flooded for an extended period of time. Some of the flooding was major. The Saline River threatened some homes and businesses in parts of Saline County around Muddy, Eldorado, and Harrisburg. In Carbondale, more than 30 mobile homes were flooded at a trailer park that was inundated by Crab Orchard Creek. A disaster proclamation was issued by the governor of Illinois due to the damage from flooding and severe storms. The National Guard was deployed to assist with sandbagging and other operations. Numerous roads were flooded and closed across southern Illinois, including some major state roads. At the peak of the flooding, 41 county and state roads were closed in Williamson County alone. A number of bridges were underwater. About 50,000 acres of farmland was flooded in Hamilton County. The flood damage from creeks and small rivers was considered to be lower than the historic March, 2008 flood in most areas. including Harrisburg. Flood gates installed around Harrisburg prevented a repeat of the massive 2008 flood, but Illinois Route 34 was closed by the flood gate.

Snowfall averaged around 3 inches in the Poconos, 6 inches in the Lehigh Valley, 6 to 12 inches in Berks, Bucks and Upper Montgomery Counties and 12 to 23 inches in and around the rest of the local Philadelphia area.  The 23.2 inches of snow that fell at Philadelphia International Airport was the second heaviest single event snowfall on record and the heaviest ever for the month of December.

Snow began around 1 a.m. EST on the 19th around the Philadelphia area, but took about twelve hours for it to reach the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos.

A strong shortwave lifted northeast across the area.  This resulted in considerable overrunning of the stalled cold front to the south of Iowa.  CAPE was in the 2000+ J/kg range with lifted indices around -11 to the south of the front.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere remained in the 500 to 1000 J/kg range, though freezing levels approached 14,000 feet.  Downdraft CAPE was significant, around 1000 J/kg, however a relatively deep layer of cool air was in place over Iowa which limited the high wind potential.  The shear in the atmosphere was fairly strong, around 50 kts.  Thunderstorms fired up over southern Iowa to the north of the warm front, while another large area formed over western Iowa and moved east.  The primary mode of severe weather was in the form of hail from nickel size to golf ball size.  High winds occurred with a few of the storms, downing trees and power lines in a few places.  The other significant weather event was the very heavy rainfall.  Daily rainfall totals of 3 to nearly 5.5 inches were common over parts of central into south central Iowa.  The Des Moines airport recorded 4.53 inches of rain by midnight to set a daily rainfall record.  Another third of an inch fell after that by 300 AM.  In Warren County at St. Marys, 5.4 inches was recorded, with 5.21 inches in Marion County at Swan.  Polk City in Polk County received 5.01 inches, with 4.61 in Windsor Heights by midnight.  Northeast of Patterson in Warren County reported a 24 hour rainfall total of 6.7 inches, with a total for the storm approaching 10 inches.  There were numerous other reports of 4 to 6 inches of rain in Warren and Marion Counties.

Sleet accumulations ranged from an inch or two in the Poconos to little if any toward Philadelphia. Ice accretions reached up to around half an inch in the Poconos. The wintry mix caused many accidents. In the Poconos, the accretion of ice on tree limbs and power lines caused scattered outages. Many schools north and west of Philadelphia were closed. 

Precipitation began as a mixture of sleet and freezing rain between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. EST across most of Eastern Pennsylvania. In the local Philadelphia area, precipitation started as plain rain. As warm air moved in northward at the surface, the freezing rain changed to plain rain in the Philadelphia northwest suburbs by 8 a.m. EST and in Berks County and the Lehigh Valley by 10 a.m. EST.  Ice accretions averaged around one tenth of an inch in the Philadelphia northwest suburbs and two tenths of an inch in Berks County and the Lehigh Valley. In the Poconos, the cold air was never completely scoured and precipitation fell as freezing rain over the plateau region until it ended that evening. 

In Monroe County layers of ice burdened branches and utility wires on February 1st, which caused power outages. Wires sagged or snapped under the weight of the ice, which resulted in some pole fires during the night of February 1st. A multi-vehicle crash at the start of the evening rush hour on February 1st forced the closure of Interstate 380 south between the Tobyhanna and Gouldsboro exits. Back roads were tricky as motorists had to dodge downed branches.  In Lehigh County, a hit-and-run accident occurred in Washington Township as icy road conditions resulted from freezing rain. The crash happened at 6:00 PM EST as an unknown driver was traveling west on Main Street in Slatedale and lost control of the vehicle due to icy patches on the road surface. The vehicle crashed into a building on Main Street and the driver left the scene. In Berks County 911 dispatchers handled more than two dozen calls which reported accidents between 5:30 AM EST and 8:00 AM EST, due to freezing rain icing up roadways. Many of the accidents involved vehicles sliding off icy roads into ditches or trees. There were no reports of serious injuries. Westbound traffic on Interstate 78 was blocked for about three hours near the Krumsville exit about 7:00 AM EST by a crash which involved several tractor-trailers. Eastbound Interstate 78 traffic was not moving much, because one lane was blocked during much of the morning as a result of crashes. Also, Interstate 78 was closed between the Kutztown exit 35 (Route 737) and Lenhartsville exit 40 (Route 143) for several hours because a tractor-trailer accident. It reopened around 9:30 AM EST. A multi-vehicle crash occurred at about 5:45 AM EST at Pricetown Road and Route 73 in Ruscombmanor Township. In Muhlenberg Township, Crystal Road was closed near Spring Valley Road after a four vehicle, chain reaction, crash occurred at about 6:15 AM EST. Several other vehicles slid into walls or other cars on the road. No one was injured, but the road remained closed for more than two hours because tow trucks had a difficult time getting up the hill to remove the vehicles. In Brecknock Township, a sport utility vehicle slid off Maple Grove Road near Alleghenyville Road at about 6:40 AM EST, then turned onto its side after going down a 10-foot embankment. The driver was not hurt. In Chester County the State Police barracks at Embreeville reported 23 crashes in the area between 5:00 AM EST and 9:00 AM EST though most were minor.  

The low pressure system that caused the wintry mix moved from Mississippi on the evening of January 31st northeast through the Ohio valley on the morning of the 1st. It reached western Pennsylvania during the afternoon of the 1st and passed near Scranton, Pennsylvania at 7 p.m. EST on the 1st before heading northeast into New York State.  Preceding this low pressure system, a fairly strong high pressure system (around 1040 millibars) was able to leave a large pool of cold air in place at the surface across Eastern Pennsylvania that was difficult for the low pressure system to scour.",731775

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.

However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north centraEVENT NARRATIVE: Earlier flash flooding evolved into record and catastrophic flooding as confirmed by emergency management personnel and USGS stream gages.  More than 40 roads across the county were completely washed out, including Post Road just south of Interstate-20.  A portion of Interstate-20 near Fairburn Road was closed for nearly 12-hours causing major traffic backups throughout the region.  The main line of the Norfolk-Southern railroad near Villa Rica was also washed out.  A seventh person in Douglas county fell victim to the raging flood waters.  A 29-year old female perished when she was swept away in her vehicle by flood waters from the Dog River at 451 am EDT.  Over 1200 residents in the county were left without power as several tress in water logged soils fell on adjacent power lines.  This primarily affected areas near and including Arbor Place Mall along Interstate-20 near Fairburn Road.  Schools throughout the county were closed because of many impassable and flooded roads.  Many homes, businesses, and roads across the county sustained tremendous damage.

The damage swath was about 2 miles wide.
Two rounds of severe weather occurred on July 25th.  The first round developed during the afternoon hours as instability increased and scattered severe storms developed and tracked across Iowa, northern Illinois and extreme southern Wisconsin.  One pulsing storm produced damaging downburst winds which toppled large trees on a golf course southeast of Monroe.  One strong supercell storm crossed into Wisconsin and propagated into Rock County where it nearly stalled and began backbuilding.  Rotating wall clouds were reported across Rock County by law enforcement.  Golf ball sized hail (1.75"") was reported from 1 NE Milton to 7 NE Milton at 1500CST, resulting in extensive crop damage.  Downburst winds were reported west, north, and northeast of Milton.  At 1507CST a rain-wrapped tornado developed 4 NNE Milton and traveled east to 5 NE Milton where it dissipated at 1511CST.  Some structural damage resulted, and winds were estimated around 85 knots (100 mph), giving this tornado a F1 ranking.  Other thunderstorms developed across Columbia and Dodge counties, producing mainly funnel clouds.

The second round of severe weather came with the cold front after 2100CST.  A line of severe thunderstorms, with some bowing segments, developed and pushed through south central and southeast Wisconsin during the late evening.  Damaging winds, which toppled large trees, with some large hail, were noted with this line.  A thunderstorm with estimated wind gusts of 65 knots (75 mph) caused a tree to be uprooted and land on a house in Baraboo at 2110 CST, causing 20,000 dollars in damage.  Near Hartford, a 20 by 20 foot section of a barn door was blown off as well as a roof of a storage garage.  A 100 by 30 foot corn patch was also flattened.

A slow moving cold front reached a Wichita to Kansas City line by late afternoon, rapidly igniting a long line of strong, slow moving thunderstorms. While the threat of damaging winds and large hail were diminished by the vast number of storms that developed along the front, excessive rainfall quickly became a concern. Training, or repeated thunderstorms tracking over the same area, deluged portions of the Kansas City metro into Cass County. Areas from Overland Park, to Grandview, to Lee's Summit, southward to Peculiar, Pleasant Hill, and adjacent communities, were hit especially hard as two and a half to four inches of rain fell in just a couple hours. Interstate 435 near the Kansas/Missouri state line was turned into a river at rush hour, with water rescues  conducted near Cleveland, Missouri to the southeast. In addition to the torrential rainfall, these storms were prolific lightning producers, with nearly continuous cloud to ground lightning, observed well into the early evening hours. National lightning detection network counts, showed total cloud to ground lightning strikes well into the tens of thousands, but thankfully no damage was reported.

The only severe weather observed in the region, was with one of the first storms that developed in western Johnson County Kansas. This long lived supercell storm tracked southeast into Cass county, and began to show signs of organized rotation as it tracked toward Harrisonville, prompting the issuance of a tornado warning. A brief tornado touched down along the south side of Harrisonville, producing roof and tree damage to a church carport, a commercial business, and a number of trees at nearby residences.EVENT NARRATIVE: Major flooding was reported along Highway 79 into the plaza.",814702

Trees and wires were toppled just before 11 pm EDT along and just east of Lake Wallenpaupack.



      For the second time in three days, significant severe weather including tornadoes affected northeastern Pennsylvania.  The primary focusing mechanisms were a strong mid level shortwave and surface cold front that approached the region during the evening of the 2nd.  Strongly veering wind profiles that increased with height contributed significantly to the development of tornadic supercells.
     Two long tracked supercells produced tornadic damage across northeastern Pennsylvania during this event.  The first tornado touched down in southwestern Susquehanna county in Auburn towship just after 9 pm EDT.  This tornado tracked along a 12 mile path through Springville and Lathrop townships.  Several mobile homes were damaged or destroyed and the roof of a small storage building was torn away.  The twister also cut down scores of trees along the way.  Its intensity was rated as F1.  Fortunately, no injuries resulted.
     The other twister tracked along approximately a 35 mile path from extreme southeastern Bradford county across the length of northern Wyoming county and into northwestern Lackawanna county before weakening.  The most devastation occurred in the small vacation community of Lake Carey in Wyoming county.  The tornado strengthened to F3 intensity at Lake Carey and killed two people and injured a total of fifteen.  More than 40 homes immediately surrounding the lake were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional residences were damaged or leveled further to the east through East Lemon township in northern Wyoming county.  Isolated structural damage and considerable tree damage was the rule from Terry township in Bradford county eastward to just west of Lake Carey and also from East Lemon township eastward to near Lackawanna State Park where the tornado finally dissipated.  In all, over 50 homes were damaged or destroyed and total damage estimates in the three county area exceeded three million dollars.
     Other smaller scale bow echo complexes produced widespread wind damage in the form of downed trees and power lines primarily across the northern tier counties and sections of the Poconos.  Portions of Bradford, Susquehanna, and Wayne counties were without power for most of the night as electrical crews could not keep up with reports of downed wires.  
     The most severely damaged areas including the Lake Carey vicinity needed assistance from the National Gaurd to clean up excess debris and help with repairs.  Much of northeastern Pennsylvania qualified for federal disaster assistance.

Wisconsin's most-costly hailstorm pummeled a large swath from around Mineral Point (Iowa Co.) to north of Milwaukee (Milwaukee Co.), while hurricane-force thunderstorm winds raked parts of Fond du Lac and Sheboygan Counties.  Here's what happened: scattered supercells developed in eastern Iowa during the late afternoon hours of April 13th and pushed east-northeastward through southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois during the evening.  Three main hailstorms affected southern Wisconsin.  The first hailstorm left a swath of hail and hail damage from southern Iowa County (around 1945CST), through central Dane County, through northern Jefferson County, through northern Waukesha County, to northern Milwaukee County by 2151CST.  This storm produced mainly 1 to 4 inch diameter hail, with a 4.25 inch hailstone reported by a State Trooper about 3 miles northwest of Lake Mills at 2055CST (larger hailstones of 4.5 to 5.7 inches in diameter have been reported in Wisconsin in previous years).  A second hailstorm developed just south of the first storm and left a swath of hail and hail damage from northern Lafayette County (around 1956CST through northern Green County, through southeast Dane County., through central and southern Jefferson County, through central Waukesha County, to central Milwaukee County by 2210CST.  This storm produced hailstones up to 1.5 inch in diameter.  The third hailstorm developed in southern Dodge County around 2056CST, and pushed through southern Washington County into central Ozaukee County by 2139CST.  This storm produced 1 to 2 inch diameter hail.  Damage was widespread and extensive with the three hailstorms.  Thousands of motor vehicles, residential homes, businesses, and farms sustained hail damage, but luckily, there were no reports of injuries or deaths.  Vehicle damage consisted of broken windows and dented sheetmetal.  Roofs, widows, and siding of buildings were damaged.  Many water-birds were killed on several inland lakes.  No crop losses were reported, given that the growing season had not started as of April 13th.

Based on partial insurance company information and some estimation, the April 13th hailstorms resulted in total damage amounts of about $158.55 million.  This makes the April 13th episode the most costly hailstorm to affect Wisconsin.  Collectively in 9 counties, at least 23,500 vehicle claims, at least 18,650 residential claims, and at least 2,515 business/farm claims were filed with various insurance companies through June 30, 2006.  These claims translated to at least $49.8 million in vehicle damage, at least $96.8 million in residential home damage, and at least $11.95 million in business/farm damage (new claims were still being filed as of June 28, 2006, therefore, these numbers may ultimately increase by 5 to 10%).   Insurance company numbers, as provided to the Milwaukee/Sullivan WFO (monetary value of claims and number of claims), were not broken down by county.  Therefore, estimated county-by-county breakdowns were derived - based on area affected in each county by hailstones 1.0 inches or larger, county population density, and relative sizes of the 20 largest insurance companies in Wisconsin. The estimated county monetary losses are: $66.59 million in Dane County, $22.2 million in both Iowa and Waukesha County, $17.44 million in Jefferson County, $7.93 million in both Milwaukee and Washington County, $6.34 million in Ozaukee County, $4.73 million in Lafayette County, and $3.17 million in Dodge County.  These county numbers were then broken down and appropriated to the largest of the individual hail reports within each county (see header strips above).

Last, but not least, a line of thunderstorms then pushed southeast out of Calumet and Manitowoc Counties through northeast Fond du Lac County and northern and eastern Sheboygan County between 2312CST and 2342CST. This line produced straight-line wind gusts up to an estimated 78 knots (90 mph) which caused extensive damage.  Northeast Fond du Lac County was affected at 2315-2320CST, extending from 1.0 mile northwest of Marytown to 1.9 miles east southeast of Marytown.  A dozen homes to sustain roof or siding damage, and on one farm a barn and a pole-shed were destroyed.  Another farm had a barn and a garage destroyed and the nearby home was moved.  Monetary damage amounts were estimated to be about $500,000 in Fond du Lac County.  Sheboygan County was affected at 2325-2345CST, extending from Elkart Lake to 5 miles south of Sheboygan.  In this area, 2 barns and 5 pole sheds were destroyed, trees and powerlines were pushed onto several cars, a roof was torn off of a home in the city of Plymouth, and a roof was torn off a garage in the Town of Plymouth.  In addition, a cargo trailer in the city of Sheboygan was blown 60 to 70 feet and smashed into a building that housed several businesses.  About 300 customers in the city of Plymouth were without power.  The Sheboygan ASOS equipment at the Sheboygan airport northwest of the city of Sheboygan recorded a gust of 58 knots (67 mph).  Monetary damage amounts were estimated to be about $400,000 in Sheboygan County.  Synopically, a stationary front draped itself over southern Wisconsin during the afternoon and evening of April 13th.  Temperatures climbed into the mid 70s across south-central and southeast Wisconsin during the afternoon.  Moderate low-level instability, cold air aloft, and strong vertical wind-shear profiles with very steep lapse-rates caused storms to fire and produce giant hail.",644300

Cold air pushed into the San Joaquin Valley, plunging temperatures to well below normal. The high at Fresno on the 4th was only 66 degrees, six degrees colder than the previous record low maximum temperature for the date of 72 degrees, set in 1954. As the push of cold air funneled through the passes of the Kern County mountains. 

The upper-level trough reached the California coast during the evening of June 4th, with the associated low dropping to west of Monterey Bay overnight. Ahead of the low, the warm front moved into the central California interior, bringing mostly light rain. Because the airmass was warm, snow levels were high, around 9000 feet. Also ahead of the front, downsloping winds developed over the Tehachapi Mountains, as well as in the Kern River Canyon. Gusts to around 50 mph were recorded at the base of the Grapevine during the morning of the 4th, but then subsided as the front arrived before increasing again the next day. The downsloping winds also brought several degrees of warming to the south end of the San Joaquin Valley. Bakersfield had a high of 83 degrees on June 5th, with the Porterville Municipal Airport only 2 degrees cooler. The California Highway Patrol weigh station at the base of the Grapevine had a high of 78 degrees on the 5th, 6 degrees warmer than the previous day. 

A pronounced dry slot developed behind the warm front, and much of the central and southern San Joaquin Valley saw dry weather for the morning of June 5th. 

An upper-level disturbance rotating around the low moved over the San Joaquin Valley during the afternoon of June 5th. This disturbance triggered showers and thunderstorms that produced heavy rain and lightning, but little hail. Fresno recorded 1.16 inch of rain on the 5th, all but 0.06 inch falling after 5 PM.

With rich moisture flowing north from the Gulf of Mexico, many of the storms were efficient rain producers, which brought the risk of flash flooding and river flooding to the area. Many locations along and southeast of the Natchez Trace Parkway corridor had already seen as much as 3 to 4 inches of rain just 3 to 4 days prior to this event. Along with the flooding, ample wind shear and strong forcing from an upper disturbance and approaching cold front brought a risk for severe thunderstorms. The best combination of wind shear and instability was located south of Interstate 20. As the upper disturbance moved closer to the region, some storms became severe with a few storms exhibiting small, tight rotation on radar. Two tornadoes occurred during this event and they were both in Hinds County.

Showers began to affect the ArkLaMiss region during the morning of the 8th. These showers increased in coverage and intensity during the afternoon and evening hours. Thunderstorms moved repeatedly over the same locations, which allowed rainfall amounts to add up quickly. Storm total rainfall ranged from 4 to 7 inches of rain, especially across southeast and eastern portions of the forecast area.

A slow moving storm moved south and east of the Mid-Atlantic Coast from Friday, May 8th through Monday, May 11th.

Measurable rain developed across the region during Friday, May 8th.  Rain was occasionally heavy during both Saturday, May 9th and Sunday, May 10th and ended on Monday, May 11th.

Heavy rain caused urban flooding of streets, poor drainage and low-lying areas.  Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 2 .50 to 5.50 inches.  Here are selected rainfall amounts for:

o  New York City - from 3.22 inches at JFK Airport to 4.22 inches at Central Park.

o  Long Island - from 4.22 inches at the NWS Office in Upton to 5.31 inches at Mt. Sinai in Suffolk County.

o  Orange County - 3.79 inches was reported at Sterling Forest.

o  Rockland County - 2.92 inches was reported at Suffern.

o  Westchester County - 3.20 inches was reported at White Plains.

Additionally, mostly minor coastal flooding was reported along the south shore of Long Island during high tides from Saturday, May 9th through Monday, May 11th.  Up to 8 inches of water inundated Woodcleft Ave. in Freeport (Nassau County) and several streets along the Fire Island Pines.

As in past heat waves, temperatures during the afternoon at valley locations across western Nevada rose to above 100 degrees.  However, it was the warm nighttime temperatures that made this heat wave nearly unprecedented.  These warm nighttime readings in Reno might have been exacerbated by the urban heat island effect that the city has been experiencing during at least the last decade.  But smaller towns across the region also experienced very warm nighttime temperatures.  Some of the records that were broken or tied:

This outbreak brought 13 tornadoes to the forecast area. This occurred as potent storm system moved out of the Rockies and developed a strong area of low pressure across the Central Plains. This surface low caused a warm front to take shape and quickly lift northward across the forecast during the afternoon of the 29th. Warm and humid conditions pushed north, which led to unstable conditions over the region just ahead of the advancing strong cold front. The wind energy through the atmosphere was strong. The resulting wind shear (change in wind speed or direction with height) was strong and very favorable for rotating storms and supporting tornadoes. As the clash of systems occurred, a mix of supercell thunderstorms developed, along with a broken line of thunderstorms. A handful of these storms utilized the strong wind shear present and produced tornadoes. Overall, 13 tornadoes occurred with 5 being of the strong variety (EF2-EF3). The strongest tornado occurred over northwest Leake and southern Attala Counties. Here, an EF3 moved along a 10 mile path and destroyed numerous mobile homes, 6 people were injured. Four other strong tornadoes occurred and were all rated EF2. Two of these occurred in Yazoo County, one just southwest of Yazoo City and the other in Downtown Yazoo City. Numerous buildings were damaged along with many trees and power lines down. Another EF2 occurred in Starkville where it destroyed multiple mobile homes in town. Fifteen injuries occurred in this area. The final EF2 occurred in Smith County. This tornado had an 11 mile path which started just SW of Raleigh to 6 miles NE of Raleigh. One brick home sustained significant damage along with numerous other buildings and sheds damaged.

The average date for isolated first reports of damaging hail over the past 20 years has been March 24th with the location typically confined to far southeast New Mexico. The March 23rd 2007 episode produced a number of large hail events from Roswell to Tucumcari and peaked with multiple tornadoes from near Tatum north to Clovis and northeast of Tucumcari. A tornado at Clovis resulted in the death of two elderly citizens, the first tornado fatalities in New Mexico since October of 1974. The episode was characterized by a slow moving upper level low that produced strong speed shear but nearly uniform southerly directional flow aloft across the eastern and southeastern sections of the state. Storms with large hail developed first during early and mid afternoon from near Roswell north to Tucumcari. Towards late afternoon and early evening as storms migrated north northeast they encountered an increasing but shallow easterly surface flow that enhanced low level shear resulting in brief but shallow tornadoes. Multiple small but elevated vortices were observed circulating around well defined wall clouds with occasional spin downs into brief tornadoes.",671221

Summary of events of June 18, 1998:

Severe thunderstorms developed over southwest Oklahoma during the early evening of the 18th and moved across southern Oklahoma, producing large hail, damaging winds, and flash flooding. Storms were particularly persistent over Jefferson County, lasting for more than 4 hours. Rainfall amounts were reported to be in excess of 10 inches near Addington. Wind gusts measured up to 86 mph, and golf ball sized hail fell during the course of the severe thunderstorms in Jefferson County. Love County sustained tree and power line damage from the storms as they tracked across south-central Oklahoma late in the evening.

EPISODE NARRATIVE: August finally marked the first substantial rainfall for the Central Tennessee Valley since we entered into the heart of the drought in early 2006.  The month began rather uneventfully with a series of mainly dry cold fronts.  The parade of cold fronts was stopped just after mid-month as Tropical Storm Fay approached Florida.  No measurable rain was observed between the 13th and 23rd although Huntsville reported trace amounts on six of those eleven days.  The big rainmaker was Tropical Storm Fay, which brought between two and eight inches of rain to the area.  

For most of the Tennessee Valley, this was the first substantially above-normal rainfall month of 2008, and in Huntsville, the first since October 2006 that was above normal at all.  The calendar day total of 2.19 inches from August 25th was also the most rainfall to occur in a calendar day since November 15th, 2006.

River base-flow actually increased as a result of Fay in North Central and Northeast Alabama, the first sign of improvement in stream-flows from the drought.  Deep groundwater also recovered to near average, and soil moisture reached near average levels for the first time in about two years.  

Drought conditions were generally status-quo during the month, with D2 /Severe Drought/ to D3 /Extreme Drought/ reported in central and eastern portions of north Alabama. Some improvement was noted at the end of the month as a result of Fay, limiting /D2/ conditions to only Jackson and DeKalb Counties.",691402

Focusing between 8 PM and midnight CDT, this small cluster of storms featured quarter size hail in Elm Creek, and estimated 60-65 MPH wind gusts in or near communities such as Overton, Axtell, and Campbell.  In Campbell, a large tree in the city park was uprooted and fell onto a gazebo. 

This storm cluster first got going across the southern Nebraska Panhandle during the mid-afternoon hours, and gradually intensified as it marched east-southeast into the local area during the evening. It started to rapidly weaken and diminish in size along the Webster-Adams County line around midnight CDT. Aloft, the synoptic scale trigger for this storm cluster was a subtle mid-level shortwave emanating from a broad, expansive trough dominating the western United States. At the surface, South Central Nebraska was located well to the north of the primary synoptic east-west frontal zone near the Kansas-Oklahoma border. Around the time storms first entered the area, favorable mesoscale severe weather parameters included around 1000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 45 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear.EVENT NARRATIVE: ",877892

This occurred during the late few days of August.  The system slowly intensified under weak steering currents and moved onshore the Louisiana coast on the 3rd.  Tropical Storm Lee was extremely slow moving at this point and consequently dumped excessive rainfall across southeast Louisiana.  A sharp upper trough began to take shape in the central U.S. on September 4th as upper energy dug southeast from Canada.  As this occurred, the remnants of Lee began to accelerate northeastward in association with the advancing upper trough.  The remnants of Lee traveled very quickly along the advancing front, racing across Georgia on the 5th.  Rain bands began to affect the area late on the 4th, but most of these were light to moderate.  On the 5th, persistent heavy rain impacted northwest Georgia and resulted in minor flooding.  Despite widespread rainfall of four to five inches across northwest Georgia with localized six to eight inches, the ongoing drought across the state resulted in minimal impacts of the heavy rain on the area,  The bigger problems came during the afternoon of the 5th when an area of strong shear, associated with the remnants of Lee, tracked from southwest to northeast across the area.  This combined with an unstable atmosphere as breaks in the clouds allowed temperatures to warm into the lower 80s.  Numerous strong thunderstorm cells developed quickly and tracked first from the Columbus area and west central Georgia into northeast Georgia.  Strong mesocyclones were indicated in many of these cells and prompted dozens of tornado warnings.  However, only one thunderstorm cell actually netted a tornado, which caused considerable damage in Cherokee county, just northwest of Atlanta.

WSR-88D storm-relative velocity data indicated strong rotation in the area at this time and a tornado warning was in effect for this part of Cobb county.  However, no tornado damage was confirmed from this signature.",898533

The hardest hit areas were in south central Missouri where Spring rainfall was also below normal.

Dry weather along with periods of above normal temperatures reduced crop yields and greatly reduced the quality of hay, corn, and soybeans grown in 1999. Hot weather in July and August also reduced the milk yield of dairy cattle. The dry weather is also already taking a toll on the winter wheat crop.

Stock ponds in many areas dried up forcing farmers to either pump or transport water for livestock. A few shallower wells reportedly ran dry. Many ranchers sold cattle and other livestock due to the lack of an adequate water supply. Some farmers compared this drought to the last severe drought in the area which occurred in 1980.

Tornado developed at the intersection of highways 1 & 218 on the southwest side of Iowa City at 1929 CST and tracked northeast through the city before lifting just northeast of the intersection of 1st Avenue & Hickory Trail at 1937 CST.  This path took it through the southeast corner of the University of Iowa campus.  This was the first tornado to hit near the campus in 35 years and the University was closed on Friday April 14th for safety reasons.

The KIOW ASOS at the airport on the southwest side of the city recorded a peak wind gust of 49 knots (57 mph) at 1931 CST.  This gust was likely the result of the rear flank downdraft as the tornado neared the intersection of U.S. 6 and highway 1 northeast of the airport.  Hard times for the location of the tornado are 1930 CST at the Wal-Mart.  At 1932-1933 CST power was lost at the Johnson County Sheriff Office with telephone lines, LAN, and automated systems going down as the tornado passed over the building.  While the tornado was passing over the sheriff's office, someone flipped the outdoor warning sirens from automatic to manual override and activated the sirens one final time.

Damage totals are still being evaluated and the $12 million amount will likely be closer to $15 million or possibly higher.  Known damage amounts include; Iowa City and Johnson County $4 million with an additional $755,000 of uninsured loses (traffic lights, signs, street lights), University of Iowa $6 million with the motor pool headquarters a total loss and 31 vehicles damaged, and $1.3 million in damage to residences/businesses.  Three automobile dealerships were damaged; one dealership had 200 vehicles damaged, a second had 60-70 vehicles damaged, and a third had nearly every vehicle sustaining some type of damage.

A total of 1,016 residential and 35 commercial buildings were damaged with some destroyed.  Some well known landmark buildings known to citizens, college students, and alumni were lost or heavily damaged.  These included the Dairy Queen (lost) and St. Patrick's Church (heavily damaged).  Several historic buildings were damaged downtown and it is unknown whether or not they can or will be saved.  The tornado damaged the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house and damaged many student apartments located just off the campus on Iowa, Dodge, and Governor streets.

Given the strength and width of the tornado it is amazing that only 30 injuries (many minor) occurred.  Many U of I students were unaware of what was happening or dashed to a nearby parking garage for safety with the tornado approaching a few blocks behind them.  Several foreign exchange students, many of whom had never seen, experienced, or heard of a tornado, were in awe and disbelief over the magnitude of the event.  At St. Patrick's Church, the Maundy Thursday evening service had just ended.  Upon being told of an approaching tornado by Decon Jerome Miller, the Reverend Rudolph Juarez ushered 50 to 75 parishioners (many elderly) to the safety of the rectory basement next door.  This action saved the lives of everyone as the tornado tore off the roof off the church and collapsed the top portion of the brick facade and the steeple into the main congregation area.",614223

This air mass had as its origin the desert southwest in the United States and a ridge of high pressure aloft brought this air mass east with it through the rest of the country. The hottest and most humid day was the 27th. This was the hottest day of the year so far for most places and the highest temperatures seen in many areas since August of 2002. The combination of high temperatures and humidity levels pushed afternoon heat indices to between 105 and 110 degrees in central and southern New Jersey on the 27th. Hospitals saw an increase in the number of patients complaining about dizziness, allergies and breathing difficulties. Elevated ozone levels exacerbated the symptoms. This time it affected more than just the elderly. 

The PJM Interconnection recorded a world record for electricity usage on the 26th: 135,000 megawatts. The PJM coordinates the movement of electricity in New Jersey and twelve other states from North Carolina to Illinois. On the 27th, PJM lowered voltage to certain customers by five percent due to the stress on the high voltage lines. Locally Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&G) (10,780 megawatts), Atlantic City Electric (2,740 megawatts), Jersey Central Power and Light (JCP&L) and the Vineland Municipal Electric Utility (Cumberland County) all set new usage records. The extra demand for electricity did cause a strain on the system and about 3,000 JCP&L customers to lose power over the 26th and 27th in Monmouth County.

Hospitals saw even bakers and construction workers suffering from heat related symptoms. The New Jersey Farm Bureau encouraged farm owners and field workers to change their schedules and avoid being outdoors or doing strenuous work during the hottest part of the day, wear hats and stay hydrated. The Hunterdon County Office of the Aging made sure all their clients had air conditioning. In Mercer County, the elderly were encouraged to go to air-conditioned libraries. In Burlington County, the elderly were encouraged to go to the air-conditioned malls.

Summary of events for May 6 1998:

Numerous severe thunderstorms developed during the late afternoon and evening over eastern Oklahoma and then moved into westcentral and northwest Arkansas between 700 and 930 PM CDT.  Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with one storm ultimately producing a tornado.

The storm that produced a tornado was the first to move into Arkansas.  It first developed over Sequoyah County in Oklahoma and then moved into northern Crawford County around 715 PM CDT.  From there, it developed very rapidly and began rotating, finally producing a tornado touchdown near Lake Fort Smith.  Besides a tornado, this storm also produced hail to the size of golfballs.  

Another cluster of severe thunderstorms, with a history of brief tornado touchdowns and funnel clouds in Oklahoma, moved across northern Crawford County between 830 and 900 PM CDT.  Finally, a severe thunderstorm with a long history of rotation and tornadoes moved across southern Sebastian County between 900 and 930 PM CDT.  Thankfully, there were no known tornadoes in Sebastian County, but the storm produced hail as large as golfballs.  

The severe thunderstorms formed as a weak cold front shifted south over the area and a wave of low pressure approached from the west and southwest.  An upper level disturbance helped to break a cap of warm air in the mid-levels which had held firm for most of the day.",311483

Snowfall of four to seven inches was common across most of north Georgia north of Interstate-20.  From Interstate-20 southward to about 50 miles, snow and sleet accumulations were mostly in the one to two inch range, but mostly freezing rain and some sleet southward for the remainder of central Georgia.  For central Georgia, the impact of the event was confined mainly to the 9th and 10th, but north Georgia, north of interstate 20, and especially areas north and northwest of Atlanta, extensive snow and ice lingered throughout the work week.  The snow and sleet accumulations were compounded by an extended period of light freezing drizzle into the 11th and nearly a week long period of temperatures remaining at or below freezing.

The significant winter storm was the result of a strong upper disturbance and strong warm advection aloft riding over a residual Arctic air mass that encompassed much of the central and eastern U.S. during this period.  The air mass that set the stage for the beginning of the event was located over the northeast U.S. early on the 9th.  Temperatures across north and central Georgia early on the 9th were in the teens, with single digits in the northeast mountains.  Additional reinforcements of Arctic air were noted during the mid part of the week.

The extensive snow and ice accumulations resulted in significant disruptions to travel and daily activities in the area.  Major interstates, roads, and highways were a meer quagmire for two to three days as cars and trucks were unable to navigate hilly sections of the roads covered with a solid sheet of ice covered snow pack.  Many roads remained like skating rinks throughout the week.

There was still some freezing rain in Sussex County.  The heaviest rain fell across eastern New Jersey where rainfall rates of an inch per hour lasted for two to three hours.  This caused flooding of some streams in Monmouth, Camden and Atlantic Counties and precipitated a mud slide that destroyed one unit of a condominium complex in Highlands (Monmouth County).  The occupants of the unit suffered natural gas inhalation, but were otherwise unharmed.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates indicated a band of very heavy rain fell diagonally across the state from Millville northeast through western Atlantic County, southern Burlington County, western Ocean County and most of Monmouth County.

On the evening of the 2nd, as one low pressure system headed into the Great Lakes, a second low pressure system formed along its frontal boundary along the coastal plains of the South Atlantic States.  Not only did this second low pressure system increase the pressure gradient (or surface pressure difference between it and a strong high pressure system over the Canadian Maritimes), but it also brought heavy rain into the state.  Urban and poor drainage flooding occurred.  This was exacerbated near the coast ( the rain was also heavier) by coinciding with the morning high tide.  In Highlands, a 20 foot by 5 foot section of South Linden Avenue caved in and sent wet earth and trees into a retention wall behind the Highland Shore Condominium Complex.  The mud and debris traveled over the retention wall and punched a 20 foot hole in the rear of the building.  The debris crashed through the floor and exited the building through the front garage.  The debris also ruptured the natural gas line (injured the two occupants) and forced the temporary evacuation of residents in the complex.  The end unit was destroyed, the adjoining unit had some structural damage; the rest were not damaged.  Elsewhere within the borough, the heavy rain and high tides forced the closure of several roads including New Jersey State Route 36.   The borough declared a state of emergency.  Water was knee deep in the downtown area.  Most roads were reopened around 130 p.m. EST.  Elsewhere in Monmouth County, kayaks were used as the means of transportation on flooded Carmel Way in Eatontown.   

In Atlantic County,  the combination of flooding along Hammonton Creek and debris clogged drains forced the closure of New Jersey State Route 54 (where water was four feet deep in spots) and five streets near the creek.  In Camden County the White Horse Pike (United States Route 30) was closed in Winslow Township.  U. S. Route 130 was also closed near the Collingswood Circle in Collingswood Borough.  There were numerous reports of poor drainage flooding in Middlesex County.   In Hunterdon County, field and basement flooding occurred.
 
Storm totals for the entire event included 4.23 inches in Ocean Grove (Monmouth County), 3.74 inches in Red Bank (Monmouth County), 3.60 inches in Estell Manor (Atlantic County), 3.52 inches in both Chatham (Morris County) and Toms River (Ocean County),  3.40 inches in Morris Plains (Morris County),  3.26 inches in Freehold (Monmouth County),  3.20 inches in Fords (Middlesex County),  3.07 inches in Millville (Cumberland County), 2.91 inches in Belmar (Monmouth County), 2.87 inches at the McGuire AFB (Burlington County), 2.86 inches in Somerville (Somerset County) and Atsion (Burlington County),  2.85 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County), 2.74 inches in Pottersville (Somerset County), 2.72 inches in Piney Hollow (Gloucester County),  2.60 inches in Belle Mead (Somerset County), 2.50 inches in Hammonton (Atlantic County),  2.42 inches in Boonton (Morris County), 2.37 inches in New Brunswick (Middlesex County), 2.25 inches in Washington Crossing (Mercer County), 2.20 inches in Sparta (Sussex County), 2.19 inches in Princeton (Mercer County),  2.13 inches in Mount Holly (Burlington County),  2.09 inches in Stewartsville (Warren County),  1.92 inches in Somerdale (Camden County), 1.85 inches in Stow Creek (Cumberland County), 1.80 inches in West Deptford (Gloucester County), 1.62 inches in Pennsauken (Camden County), 1.56 inches in Andover (Sussex County),  1.38 inches at the Marina within Atlantic City, 1.37 inches in Hainesville (Sussex County)",364914

EPISODE NARRATIVE: An intense fall cyclone developed over the region and produced an episode of severe weather which included tornadoes. This strong weather system developed as a very strong jet stream, with winds between 160-200 mph, slammed into Oregon and Washington State. All that energy moved over the Rocky Mountains and caused a strong area of surface low pressure to develop. This low intensified as it moved east across the Red River Valley and then lifted across Arkansas and into Tennessee as it deepened to 990 mb! The strength of this deepening low caused warm and unstable air to lift northward across Louisiana and into central Mississippi. It was this northward moving warm front that became the focus of an area where tornadic supercell thunderstorms could thrive in an unstable and highly sheared environment.
This large and powerful storm system produced numerous tornadoes across the south and south eastern United States where many were of the strong (F2 or F3) variety. Within the Jackson, MS forecast area, there were a total of 5 tornadoes to impact the counties serviced. Two F3s, one in Lamar County and the other in Jones County. The Jones County tornado actually contained a satellite tornado, F1, which briefly rotated around the parent tornado.

An off-duty National Weather Service meteorologist reported that a car was stranded in high water at the intersection of Bluebird and Midkiff Streets in Midland.  Flooding was reported by the sheriff's office on Wadley Avenue, Loop 250, Texas Highway 191, A Street, Cuthbert, Andrews Highway, and I Street.  Many cars were submerged, leaving their occupants stranded.  Nineteen high water rescues were reported by the Midland Fire Department.  The broadcast media reported two to three feet of water flowing across the intersection of Garfield and Golf Course Road, where eight additional rescues were conducted by media personnel and the public.  Several streets around Midland were barricaded including County Road 1150 between Texas Highways 158 and 307.


A cold front that stretched from the Davis mountains northeast across the Permian Basin initiated a series of training thunderstorms that persisted over the Permian Basin for 48 hours.  Rain began on the afternoon of the 13th and continued through the afternoon of the 15th causing major flooding problems across the area.  The Colorado River and the Rio Grande went into flood and flash flooding occurred over many urban and rural areas.  

In Midland, officials activated the Emergency Operations Center on Sunday to coordinate resources in response to flooding across the city.  Downed power lines and stranded motorists were only a couple of the problems experienced due to the record rainfall and flash flooding.  Officials barricaded intersections that are especially prone to flooding.  Emergency management officials declared a partial state of emergency in the city due to the amount of flooding and the number of motorists stranded.  Twenty high water rescues were performed by firefighters on Sunday.  Both the National Weather Service office and the police received several reports of children playing in high water flowing down city streets.  Despite these reports, no injuries were reported.  

Elsewhere across the Permian Basin, only one other high water rescue was performed, in Snyder.  Streets were flooded with anywhere from half a foot of water up to three feet of water, causing many roads to be barricaded.",598225

Hail up to baseball size and winds of 60 to 100 mph affected many communities and their surrounding areas as well as several Hutterite colonies. The communities affected included, Roscoe, Faulkton, Cresbard, Chelsea, Mellette, Ashton, Redfield, Turton, Doland, Raymond, Clark, Carpenter, Willow Lake, Vienna, Hazel, Hayti, and Lake Norden.  Also, the Hillcrest, Clark, Fordham, Hillside, and Mayfield colonies were affected.  

Thousands of acres of crops were damaged or destroyed along with tens of  homes, campers, barns, sheds, silos, grain bins, and road signs.  A lot of equipment housed in the outbuildings  was damaged or destroyed.  At one farm north of Willow Lake, all of the outbuildings were destroyed, many of the house windows were broken with six feet of the chimney taken off.  At another farm, a fairly large camper  trailer was upside down in a tree.  Five mobile homes were severely damaged or destroyed along the path of the storm while hundreds of trees were uprooted, snapped off, or lost large branches.  Some of these trees fell on and damaged several vehicles and homes.   The high winds also lifted the roofs off of some of the houses.  Many power lines and poles were downed resulting in extensive power outages for several communities for up to a day.  Telephone service was also interrupted across some of the area.  Many twelve hundred pound hay bales  were rolled hundreds of feet.  Several semi tractor trailors were also blown over by the high winds.  On Highway 28, west of Carpenter, a mail truck was blown over, blocking the road for several hours.   The tractor was totaled.  The largest hail occurred mainly across south central Edmunds and northeast Faulk counties where the hail combined with the winds and took out many windows on homes, vehicles, buildings, and also dented several vehicles.  At one farm in south central Edmunds, thirteen vehicle windshields were broken.  There were only minor injuries reported with this storm with millions of dollars in damage.    ",340190

The first two storms developed quickly over central Wisconsin and then tracked east-southeast through the Fox Cities. These two storms primarily produced large hail (1 to 2 inches in diameter) and some wind damage. A brief tornado touched down with the first storm near Menasha (Winnebago co.).  The third storm developed farther north in the northeast part of the state. This storm evolved more slowly, but went through the classic life-cycle of a tornadic supercell and spawned an F3 tornado in Door county.

Large hail struck the Fox Cities, especially Appleton, producing over $5 million in damage to vehicles and roofs of buildings.  This was the second multi-million dollar hailstorm this year in Appleton.  In Sherwood (Calumet co.), hail damage to a golf course was so severe that it did not open until two days later.  In Brillion (Calumet co.), hail shattered large glass panels of a church.

The most severe damage occurred when a tornado tore a path 5.1 miles long and over a half-mile wide across Door county.  The tornado came onshore from Green Bay at Murphy Park, on the Door county west coast at 630 pm.  Thousands of trees were flattened in the heavily wooded area.  About 30 homes, businesses and barns were destroyed or heavily damaged by the storm, but only two minor injuries were reported.  Some livestock, however, including five horses, were lost.  The tornado knocked down seven power poles holding electrical transmission lines, bringing blackouts to most of the north half of Door county.  Thirty adults and 17 children at a campground found refuge in a concrete building as the tornado approached the grounds.  Two minor injuries occurred at the camping resort as it took a direct hit.  The twister made it almost two-thirds of the way across the county, before dissipating about 3 miles west of the Door county east coast.",347321

Snowfall totals ranged from 2 to 3 inches along the the North Oregon Coast to from 2 to 8 inches in the Willamette Valley and up to 27 inches in the Cascade Mountains.  Accumulations of up to 2 inches of sleet and freezing rain followed the snowfall. The Portland metropolitan area received 5 to 8 inches of snow, followed by one to two inches of sleet and freezing rain, which limited or halted most forms of travel and resulted in cancellation of over 1300 flights at Portland International Airport, stranding 90,000 passengers. Portland's light rail train system was shut down during the peak of the freezing rain January 6th and 7th. Most businesses and schools were also closed on January 6th and 7th, longer in many areas. Blizzard conditions in the Columbia River Gorge resulted in the closure of Interstate 84 between Troutdale, Oregon and Hood River Oregon, and Washington State Route 14 between Washougal, Washington and White Salmon , Washington during the same period, halting east-west travel through the Gorge and stranding hundreds of trucks at both ends of the Gorge.

The roof over a boat marina in Scappoose collapsed, sinking 4 boats and damaging many others. Snowfall in the Cascades ranged from 8 inches at Blue Box Pass and Bennett Pass to 27 inches at Timberline Lodge and White River. President Bush declared Northwestern Oregon a Disaster Area, and Oregon Governor Kulongoski estimated the cost of damages to public property at $16 million. No deaths or serious injuries were attributed to the storm.",551838

Although the Flood of 2001 saw higher crests on the Mississippi River, that flood affected primarily the Mississippi River itself and only a few of its tributaries.  This year's flood event affected the Mississippi River as well as many of its tributaries.

A series of moderate to record high rainfall events continued the flooding at many locations that set flooding in motion at other locations.  The most notable heavy rainfall event occurred from April 24-25 when 5 or more inches of rain fell from north central Iowa into southern Wisconsin.  The Iowa, Cedar, Wapsipinicon and Maquoketa River basins received the heaviest rainfall.  With soil moisture at or above the 95th percentile for that time of year, much of the rainfall became runoff and quickly ran into streams and creeks.  The initial result was flash flooding especially across northeast Iowa. The event then transitioned to a river flood event, with major to near record crests experienced on the Cedar, Wapsipinicon and Maquoketa Rivers.  The Mississippi River also experienced major flooding.  All forecast points on the Mississippi River from Dubuque to Keokuk topped flood stage.

However, very strong winds developed as an area of low pressure intensified across central Minnesota. This caused blizzard, or near blizzard conditions across a portion of west central Minnesota Monday morning, with winter storm conditions spreading south and east across the remainder of southern Minnesota during the afternoon and evening of January 12th. 

A blizzard watch was issued over 36 hours before the event began, with winter storm warnings issued 6 to 12 hours before blizzard conditions were met across west central Minnesota. Several areas along the far western border of Minnesota reported sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph, along with frequent gusts of 45 to 50 mph near Madison, Appleton, and other areas across Lac Qui Parle, western Chippewa, and western Swift counties. Even though not all areas reported three consecutive hours of sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph along with visibilities of 1/4 of a mile or less, numerous communities had several hours of one mile or less in blowing snow, with wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph. 

Some areas of east central Minnesota did not receive the strong winds, but a few bands of intense snowfall rates caused areas just south of the Twin Cities to receive between four and six inches of snow. 

Even after the snow stopped during the evening, strong winds and falling temperatures caused dangerously cold wind chill values. 

The following are wind chill values obtained during the height of the coldest temperatures and highest wind speeds around the area.

Strong upper level dynamics moved over the state over the top of an unstable air mass.  Surface dew point temperatures were in the low 70s with actual temperatures in the upper 70s to low 80s.  CAPE values rose to between 2500 and 3500 J/kg.  The situation became complex during the afternoon as several bands of severe thunderstorms developed.  Some areas of the state were affected three times during the day as the storms raced northeast around 60 MPH.  The main severe feature with the storms was high wind.  There were numerous reports of wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH.  Some were even higher.  One of the highest reports came from Atlantic in Cass County.  Ninety one MPH winds there threw several cars and a few semi-tractortrailer trucks off of Interstate 80.  High winds in Kossuth County at Algona resulted in roof damage at a nursing home there.  Part of the roof was removed by the winds with the damage estimates to the building places at around $200,000.  Another cluster of storms moved into north central Iowa and caused widespread damage in Cerro Gordo and Worth Counties.  Both were hit with winds around 70 MPH.  There were numerous other reports of damage to farm buildings around the state ranging from corn cribs damaged to barns being destroyed.  Damage to trees and power lines was extensive.  North of Algona, along U.S. Highway 169, seventy eight power poles were downed by the high winds resulting in a four day closure of the highway.  Utility damage around the county was estimated at between $600,000 and $800,000, while insurance adjusters estimated damage around the county at $1.2 million.  There were some reports of hail, especially during the first few hours of the event.  The largest hail was around golf ball in size.  In addition to the wind and hail, there were several tornado touch downs in the state.  A tornado touched down in Kossuth County and did over $1 million in damage.  The tornado destroyed 2 houses with another 10 sustaining major damage.  Fifteen farmsteads were destroyed as well.  Kossuth County was later declared a disaster area.  There was also considerable damage to barns and other farm buildings across the county.  The outflow from the tornadic storm in Kossuth County pushed an 85 MPH wind gust south into Humboldt County.  The high winds blew over 41 railroad cars of the Union Pacific Railroad south of Ottosen.  A band of 80 to 90 MPH winds swept across Franklin and Butler Counties.  Damage was widespread.  There was one report of the wind carrying the family dog over one half mile from home.  The dog was later found safe and healthy.  Another of the stronger tornadoes included one in Wright County that was on the ground for over 10 miles.  It damaged several farm buildings along its path.  Several 2 x 4's were driven into the ground north of Clarion by the tornado.  Another fairly strong tornado touched down in Crawford County.  The rope tornado touched down southeast of Denison.  It hit a train about 3 miles east of Denison and derailed nine cars of the Union Pacific freight train.  The engineer saw it coming and thought it was so small that nothing would happen.  There was also minor damage to 1 house and several out buildings.  There were a few other brief touch downs around the state, however no damage was reported with them.   The rapid movement of the storms prevented a lot of the flooding that would have otherwise occurred.  Repeat thunderstorms passing over Kossuth County did cause some urban flooding.  Damage was relatively minor, however several homes reported minor flooding.  As the storms moved across Hancock County, lightning struck a house in the town of Britt.  The kitchen sink was blown away from the wall and all of the appliances and the electrical equipment in the house was damaged.  Lightning struck very close to another house in Wright County in Belmond.  A 75-year old woman received minor injuries as she was struck by lightning as she unplugged her TV near a large window.",319308

Storm assessment teams from the National Weather Service in St. Louis evaluated the most intense damage which occurred over northeast Missouri and west central Illinois.  From the extreme damage that occurred in localized areas, it appears that wind speeds reached 70 to 100 mph. The extensive nature of the damage caused power outages to at least 55,000 customers. Some did not have power return until Tuesday night.  Also, there were several reports of flash flooding, especially over northeastern Missouri due to the already saturated soils from previous rains over the past week.EVENT NARRATIVE: An intense bow echo moved through Coatsburg, Camp Point and Clayton.  Hundreds of trees, tree limbs and power lines were blown down.  A couple of power poles were also snapped off.  Several trees and tree limbs landed on homes causing minor to moderate roof damage.  Also, in Camp Point the entire roof of a business was blown off.  One woman was injured after falling down her basement steps as her family was taking shelter from the storm.  It took more than an hour for an ambulance to respond to the woman's home near Coatsburg because of the downed trees blocking highways and lots of secondary roads.",874757

A southern swath of severe weather was caused by a supercell which moved through Dickinson, Morris, Lyon, and Osage counties.  Hail up to the size of baseballs was reported as well as strong winds up to 90 to 100 mph.  A house and its attached garage near Hope, KS were seriously damaged as a result of the strong winds just south of the supercell.  Other outbuildings were also destroyed near Hope.

Another swath of more widespread severe weather presented itself just south of the Kansas/Nebraska border as numerous supercells moved eastward through north central and northeastern Kansas.  Hail up to the size of baseballs was reported throughout much of the area during the late evening to overnight hours. Strong 80 mph winds caused a large amount of damage to outbuildings throughout Republic county.

The low eventually tracked from southwest Iowa in the afternoon to east central Iowa by early evening.  To the southeast of the front, temperatures warmed into the upper 70s to mid 80s, with dew point temperatures in the upper 50s to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with lifted indices falling to -5 to -8 Celsius and CAPE rising to 2000-3000 J/kg.  The situation was very dynamic with a synoptic scale upper level trough to the west and broad southwest flow over the central U.S.  The jet at 300 mb was around 100 kts with 500 mb winds southwest at 75+ kts.  This aided in producing deep layer shear of 75 to 100 kts over southeast Iowa by late afternoon.  Ample inflow was present with moisture transport at the 850 mb level produced by a 35 to 40 kt flow.  This increased precipitable water values to between 1 and 1.2 inches.  Thunderstorms fired along the frontal boundary during the mid to late afternoon as the front became a cold front.  With 300-400 J/kg of CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere, and 700-1000 J/kg of downdraft CAPE available, the atmosphere was loaded for the production of wind and hail.  In addition, the freezing level was a relatively low 12,000 feet.  The line of thunderstorms that formed ahead of the advancing cold front became severe quickly, producing large hail.  Much of the hail was in the 1 to 1.5 inch diameter range, however there were several reports of golf ball to tennis ball size hail.  The largest hail was over northeast Iowa with golf ball size reported in Grundy County, and tennis ball size from the northwest edge of Waterloo toward Cedar Falls in Black Hawk County.  Also in Black Hawk County, a few stones were measured to 3.5 inches in diameter in Cedar Falls.  As the system unfolded, the storms began to produce high winds.  Wind gusts of 75 to 100 MPH occurred withEVENT NARRATIVE: ",800466

The initial rounds of significant severe storms targeted the area during a 7-hour stretch centered from 9 PM CDT Sunday evening to 4 AM CDT Monday morning. During this nocturnal event, multiple severe supercell and multicell storms pounded mainly the northwest half of South Central Nebraska, or locations northwest of a line from Beaver City to Grand Island to Osceola. Generally speaking, severe weather during this 7-hour period came in three separate rounds, although there was some overlap in both time and area. Despite a favorable environment for tornadic development, no tornadoes were confirmed during this event. 

The first round of severe weather, centered between 9 PM and 11 PM CDT, involved one large, intense supercell storm that drifted east out of southwest Nebraska, primarily impacting Furnas, Gosper, Harlan and Phelps Counties. This storm resulted in several reports of destructive hail up to tennis ball size, and winds of at least 60-70 MPH. One of the hardest hit areas was northern Furnas County in and around Cambridge and Arapahoe, where damage reports included the displacement of a 5-ton air handling unit atop the hospital in Cambridge, and a stock trailer thrown into a corn field.

As the initial supercell started to gradually weaken, a new area of vigorous severe storm development took place north of Interstate 80, expanding in coverage between 11 PM and 2 AM CDT. The most intense storm during this time frame tracked nearly due east from Sherman County to northern Polk County, with reports along the way including hail to the size of tennis balls and baseballs. Some of the worst known wind damage occurred in Merrick County, where estimated winds to 80 MPH destroyed an old grain elevator between Clarks and Silver Creek.

A dynamic upper level system approached Iowa from the northwest during the afternoon.  Several boundaries were in the area resulting from weak convection that took place during the morning.  Very strong theta-e advection took place over northeast Nebraska during the morning and early afternoon hours.  In addition, several other factors came into play.  Moisture continued to stream into Iowa from the remnants of Hurricane Carlotta as precipitable water values approached 2.2 inches.  Iowa was also under the influence of a coupled jet structure.  As a result a strong upper level divergent field was in place over the state.  By afternoon, mid and upper level cold air advection began to take place as well.  Strong convection took place by mid day over northeast Nebraska into west central Iowa.   The line of thunderstorms moved into rich air with surface dew points in the low to mid 70s.  The main feature with the storms was high winds.  The line of thunderstorms took on a bow echo configuration as it moved across southern Iowa.  Most of the southern three tiers of counties reported high winds.  Wind speeds of 60 to as much as 85 MPH were reported with the storms.  Wind speeds topped out at 85 MPH at New Virginia, in Warren County.  Damage was widespread with numerous trees and power lines downed by the winds.  Some trees up to 2 feet in diameter were snapped.  A flag pole was reported bent 4 inches by the high winds as well.  One tornado was reported in Warren County as well.  This was a brief tornado near St Marys which caused no damage.  The other problem with the storms was the heavy rainfall.  Two to three inches of rain fell in many areas.  As the storms moved into parts of south central and southeast Iowa, they moved into area that had been inundated by heavy rainfall just two nights before.  Flash flooding was reported in Appanoose, Lucas, Mahaska, Monroe, Wayne, Davis, and Wapello Counties.  Numerous roads were under water in these counties.    U.S. Highway 63 was closed by high water  north of Ottumwa.  Some of the worst flooding took place in Mahaska County where heavy rain fell on areas that had been flooded two days before.  At least 15 roads were reported under water in the county.  As the thunderstorms moved through Hamilton County, lightning struck a tree outside of a house in Stratford.  It also left a hole in the ground and caused damage inside the house.  The lightning strike broke windows out of the front of the house and also caused windows to break in the house next door.  Later, the storms moved into the Waterloo area.  Lightning struck the chimney of a former school building.  The top part of the chimney was blown off by the lightning and a good part of the rest of the chimney was damaged.

Actually, this was a two-part severe weather event, with the first round of storms sliding across the northern counties on Sunday evening mainly between 5 and 7 PM CDT, and the second round tracking through almost the exact same area several hours later between 1130 PM and 1 AM early Monday morning. 

The first round of storms was essentially the far southern extension of a maturing quasi-linear mesoscale convective system (MCS) that had been tracking across northern Nebraska for several hours before entering the local area. This line of storms resulted in quarter size hail in Greeley. After a multi-hour lull, the second round of severe storms entered Valley County around midnight as a small, but intense bowing multicell cluster. As with the first round, these storms had been approaching from northwest Nebraska for several hours. These storms also produced quarter size hail, with the combination of hail and gusty winds breaking a convenience store window in Ord. The dominant cell weakened considerably by the time it reached far northern Polk County, and although additional storms affected other parts of South Central Nebraska through the night, none of them became severe. 

The synoptic scale environment was supportive of multiple clusters of storms tracking through the same region, as a strong mid-level shortwave trough tracked from the northern Rockies into the Dakotas. The enhanced mid-level flow along the southern reaches of this trough promoted strong deep-layer vertical wind shear around 50 knots. Instability-wise, most-unstable CAPE values through the evening hours averaged 2000-4000 J/kg. At the surface, South Central Nebraska waEVENT NARRATIVE: ",878339

The worst tornadoes and majority of the severe weather occurred to the north of our service area. However, our region did receive quite of a bit of weather with several weak tornadoes, large hail, and wind damage. The worst storm in the Jackson, MS service area was a supercell thunderstorm which tracked across southeast Arkansas and northwest Mississippi. This storm produced several weak tornadoes, but will be know for the very large hail and damage it produced. Hail between baseball and softball size occurred during some of its life with golf ball size occurring throughout its life. Dozens of vehicles were damaged along the path from the very large hail.

The day was setup by near record high temperatures and a very moist and unstable atmosphere. A potent low pressure system and cold front developed over North Texas early Tuesday. As the area of low pressure deepened and tracked northeast across Central Oklahoma and Northwest Arkansas the combination of unstable air and strong wind shear lead to a tornado and severe weather outbreak across the Southeast US. This was just the first round of severe storms to impact the region. A line of storms developed along a pre-frontal trough early Tuesday evening and quickly moved east across the area through early Wednesday morning bringing with it damaging winds and hail.

This outbreak of severe storms produced a little over 80 tornadoes which were responsible for 56 fatalities and hundreds of injuries across about 9 states. Of those 80 plus tornadoes, 5 were rated EF3 and 5 more rated EF4. The longest tornado occurred in north-central Arkansas and was on the ground for 123 miles and was rated and EF4. This was the longest single tornado track recorded in Arkansas since detailed reporting began in 1950.",715780

Summary of events for May 6:

Numerous severe thunderstorms developed over eastern Oklahoma during the late afternoon and evening hours of May 6.  Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with some storms ultimately producing tornadoes.  

The first thunderstorms of the day developed over central Oklahoma and then moved eastward toward Okfuskee County after 430 PM CDT, traversing the counties along and just north of I-40 through 730 PM CDT before exiting into Arkansas to the east of Stilwell and Sallisaw.  These thunderstorms produced large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, and two brief tornado touchdowns in Muskogee County.  Other severe thunderstorms developed behind the first cluster, producing severe weather primarily in Creek and Okmulgee Counties from 700 PM to 830 PM CDT.

Other severe thunderstorms developed rapidly around 600 PM CDT along a weak cold front across the northern border counties of Oklahoma.  These storms primarily produced large hail.  

Further south in southeast Oklahoma, a cap of warm air in the mid-levels of the atmosphere prevented thunderstorm development until around 700 PM CDT with the approach of an upper level disturbance.  Once thunderstorms developed in Pittsburg County, they rapidly became severe and began rotating.  These storms moved east across Haskell and northern Le Flore Counties through 900 PM CDT, producing large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, several brief tornado touchdownsand a tornado producing considerable damage in the small town of Calhoun in northwestern Le Flore County.  At the time of the Calhoun tornado, the WSR-88D near Fort Smith had its first algorithm-induced tornado vortex signature (TVS).  ",336156

Most were in the northern part of the state as the combination of strong north winds, low humidity levels and a very dry March made it easy for fires to spread rapidly.

In Salem County, fifteen acres of farmland and wooded areas were consumed by a wildfire in Elsinboro Township during the afternoon. Firefighters responded to Featherbed Lane around 2 p.m. EDT after a controlled burn meant to destroy phragmites raged out of control. Ten acres of farmland were left almost completely torched as fire crews from Elsinboro and other area municipalities battled the blaze for approximately two hours. Pockets of fire continued to jump around due to strong north winds, and at one point reached into a heavily wooded area about a quarter mile from where the fire began along the banks of a small creek. Firefighters were able to douse the flames before it spread up the trees. 

In Sussex County, a brush fire affected just over ten acres near a residential community in Wantage Township. The wildfire was in a grass field adjacent to houses. Forest Fire volunteers managed to protect the homes. In Warren County, a wildfire broke out in Oxford, where five acres were burned. Other brush fires also occurred in Knowlton and Washington Townships. A minor brush fire also occurred on the afternoon of the 24th in Frelinghuysen Township. In Hunterdon County, a small wildfire burned for about 45 minutes and consumed more than an acre of farm field near Ridge Road in Kingwood Township. 
 
The peak wind gusts on the 23rd at both Philadelphia and Newark Liberty International Airports were 38 mph.EVENT NARRATIVE: ",753535

Several sections of a large irrigation system were also tipped over. Peak winds were estimated at 115 mph. Some crops were damaged in Owego Township. EPISODE NARRATIVE: At 3 pm CST on the 15th, a stationary front was located from near Minot (ND) to Jamestown (ND) to near Sisseton (SD). South of the front, mid afternoon temperatures ranged in the mid 80s to lower 90s. To the north of the front, a meso-high had formed, with much cooler and drier air around it. The temperature across the boundary ranged from 89F at Minot, to 73F at Devils Lake, to 64F at Crookston. The upper air pattern had a western ridge and an eastern trough, putting the northern plains in northwest flow aloft. A strengthening upper jet also moved toward eastern North Dakota, giving this system good surface and upper level support.

A supercell thunderstorm developed over southern Steele County around 530 pm CST and tracked across western Cass County and into eastern Ransom County before weakening after 7 pm CST. Then, another supercell thunderstorm formed over northern Steele County around 725 pm CST. This storm tracked just west of the path of the first storm, again mainly hitting central Steele County, western Cass County, and eastern Ransom County, before weakening around 915 pm CST. Both thunderstorms tracked south-southeast at speeds between 40 and 50 mph and spawned multiple tornadoes which were embedded within the overall downburst wind and hail pattern.

The significant downburst wind and wind driven hail was seen in two partially overlapping paths, with each path from 5 to 7 miles wide and between 60 and 80 miles long (this damage path showed up clearly on satellite images). The strength of these winds is believed to have exceeded 80 mph with speeds over 100 mph in some localized areas. Hail sizes ranged from penny to hen egg sized.

Most areas received considerable hail damage at the same time as the strong winds. Law enforcement officials and witnesses stated that the hail often persisted for longer than 5 minutes and completely covered the ground. The hail damaged roofs, windows, and siding in many homes along the damage path. Stripped and decimated corn, bean, and wheat fields were typical along the entire storm path too. The ND Farm Service Administration estimated losses occurred on over 700,000 acres in five counties. Total crop losses may exceed $250 million, with other property losses from $15 to $20 million. Cass and Steele Counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration.",674261

The thunderstorms continued to develop and increase in coverage as they moved into Eastern Iowa during the late afternoon and evening.  The storms were aided by strong surface based instability and a strong wind maxima in the mid levels of the atmosphere.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds were received.  The thunderstorms also produced penny to golfball sized hail and strong damaging winds.  There were 3 brief tornado touchdowns.  One occurred near Aurora in Buchanan County, with the others occurring near Backbone State Park in Delaware County, and in LeClaire in Scott County.  No damage was reported with either the Buchanan or Delaware County tornadoes, however the LeClaire tornado caused widespread tree damage.

EPISODE NARRATIVE: Low pressure developed over Kansas with a strong southerly flow of very moist air streaming into Iowa ahead of it.  Surface temperatures warmed into the 80s with dew point readings in the low to mid 70s.  A semi-stationary front extended northeast from the low, across northern Iowa during the afternoon into the evening hours.  The atmosphere became very unstable with MUCAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range by mid afternoon and lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear was quite high, between 40 and 70 kts.  Downdraft CAPW was between 1000 and 1300 J/kg with cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere around 400 J/kg.  The LCL was in the 750 to 1000 meter range, with the lowest over north central Iowa.  With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.  A second death occurred in Wright County as a 50 year old male farmer near Galt was sucked into a culvert by flood waters as he checked the field tiles in his farm field.",704091

Thunderstorms ravaged a large part of south central Nebraska with hail, high winds, a tornado and catastrophic flooding.

During evening and early morning hours, 4 to 12 inches of fell from Dawson County east to York County. At Kenesaw and Wood River, over 11 inches of rain was measured. The city of Grand Island set a rainfall record for a single event with 7.21 inches of rain. Statically, this event was a 100 year rain and flood event for the area. 
	
In Wood River, 12 people were evacuated due to rising water. It was estimated every structure in Wood River sustained some sort of storm damage and wave after wave of severe thunderstorms pounded the town. Twelve homes sustained severe damage. The Wood River crested at 9 feet in town and flooding most streets.  Thirty-six homes were evacuated in the city of Grand Island as flooding was rampant over the west and north part of the city. The city's sewer system handled about 75 million gallons of water, or about 6 times the normal amount during the storm. Many parts of the business and residential districts sustained flood damage as the Prairie, Silver and Moores Creeks flooded. The Wood River near Alda, which had been dry for three years, tied a record with a crest of 12.2 feet early on the 12th. Elsewhere, three miles of roads were washed out in Kearney County and 15 miles of roads were damaged in Merrick County. Ten bridges were damaged in Merrick County as well. In York County, emergency rescues, one by helicopter and one by air boat, were made to retrieve stranded people trapped by flood waters southeast of Waco and near McCool Junction. Water was over Highway 81 north of Fairmont at the height of the event. In Fillmore and York counties, 5 to 8 inches of rain fell. Further west, a section of Highway 40 was washed out near Miller. Flood damage was in the tens of millions of dollars, with 12 to 15 million dollars in damage in Hall County alone. 
	
As flooding rains soaked the region, large hail, high winds and one tornado pounded the area. Hastings was particularly hard hit as baseball size hail and high winds belted the city for about 20 minutes. Literally, thousands of vehicles and homes sustained damage, especially on the east side of town, including downtown. Damage was estimated at 40 million, and that may be conservative and insurance agencies processed claims. State Farm Insurance was expecting to process 3,000 claims alone. Thirty-three people left their homes for shelter provided by the city. In Wood River, a tornado clipped the south side of town. In Merrick County, two Union Pacific trains derailed due to high winds and a tower for KMMJ radio was blown down north of town. A communications tower was also destroyed in Buffalo County by high winds. There were widespread, though brief, power outages in the area. At one point, about 60 percent of the city of Lexington was without power. Twelve center pivot irrigation systems were damaged in Fillmore County. High winds destroyed a barn southeast of Gothenburg and grain binds south of Darr in Dawson County. Officials estimate, 2800 homes and businesses had damaged in Grand Island. Both Hall and Adams Counties were declared Federal Disasters Areas.",584795

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote ""there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa"".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l  ",320112

Flooding was the result of significant winter snows and significant spring rains, not only in North Dakota but in Montana as well. Rocky Mountain snowpack was four to six times normal. Flooding was along the Missouri River from the Garrison Dam to the South Dakota border. Dams were overwhelmed by the amount of water. Flooding included river, ground, and overland types. Estimated damages were in the hundreds of millions of dollars and that is not all inclusive. There was a significant loss to agriculture by not being able to plant. A tremendous flood fight was waged against the river, and that cost is not included here. Storm Data cannot reflect the scope of this event. Information is what was available at the time of this writing. Refer to newspaper articles and other federal, state, and local sources for detailed information.

Here are some facts about the flooding in North Dakota provided by North Dakota Emergency Management. The total estimated flood cost was around $1.5 billion. Individual and housing assistance was $323 million; small business $248 million; home and business reconstruction $452 million; public response, recovery, and mitigation $480 million; disaster unemployment for 866 claims was $2.3 million; and the public finance authority disaster loan program approved $56.6 million. Public infrastructure costs were $320 million. Of the state's 53 counties, 48 were impacted, along with three tribal nations.

The Missouri River was in flood in every state in the United States of America that it runs through. This was a multi-state disaster.EVENT NARRATIVE: See the event episode narrative for details.",880591

Temperatures were unseasonably warm across the area and moisture levels near to above seasonal normals.  A vigorous short wave, embedded within the strong westerly flow, and associated strong Pacific cold front quickly traversed the area during the early morning hours of the 25th.  A significant low-level jet and strong low-level shear were noted with this system contributing to strong low-level linear forcing.  Thus, synoptic conditions were favorable for a narrow line of showers and thunderstorms, or quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) to quickly traverse the area during the early morning hours.  Most of the thunderstorms were marginally severe blowing down a few trees.  Some of the trees also landed on and brought down power lines.

				November 2nd-5th Episode Narrative

Heavy rain fell across portions of north Texas during the first part of November.  These rains served as the precursor of a very wet month over the region.  On the 2nd and 3rd rains were confined mainly to the southern and eastern portions of the area from near Hamilton, to Palestine, to Sulphur springs.

Widespread moderate to heavy rainfall occurred across north Texas on the 5th as a slow moving front progressed across the area.  Numerous reports of flash flooding were received as the rain caused various degrees of damage over the area.

But in the Poconos, around one-third of an inch of ice accrued on exposed surfaces. Driving on untreated roads were treacherous. In Berks County, weather related accidents occurred in at least five municipalities.

Police were forced to close Pennsylvania State Route 73 between Friedensburg Road in Oley Township and Pricetown Road in Ruscombmanor Township because of several accidents. 

The cause of the freezing rain was a wedge of cold air that remained trapped in the valleys of Eastern Pennsylvania. A low pressure system developed in Oklahoma the morning of the 13th and moved northeast to near Pittsburgh during the early morning of the 14th. The westward location of the low permitted warmer air near the ground to move into the region from the nearby Atlantic Ocean. Precipitation began spreading northeast as freezing rain or drizzle around 6 p.m. EST on the 13th and the change to plain rain was completed by around 3 a.m. EST on the 14th.

Summary of events for April 24 1999:

Thunderstorms formed on the morning of April 24 along a stationary front running east-west across southeast Oklahoma.  Some of these storms became severe during the day, producing marginally severe hail and wind.  

However, most of these thunderstorms moved eastward along a similar path running across Pittsburg, Latimer, and northern Pushmataha Counties.  This led to saturated grounds and flash flooding.  Listed here are some of the heavier rainfall amounts from the area for the day (in inches):  Stuart_3SE Stuart...4.29, McCurtain_1SE...2.75, Clayton_15WNW...2.60, McAlester_4S...2.10, and Wilburton_2SW...1.41",368659

The system was quite dynamic for mid August as the upper level low pressure closed off over Minnesota during the evening and a 70 kt jet was present at 300 mb.  The atmosphere became unstable as afternoon readings reached the upper 70s to around 80, with dew points in the upper 60s.  Instability was limited by the fact that there were two rounds of thunderstorms that crossed the state during the day, limiting the heating.  None the less, lifted indices fell to around -8 C and between 2000 and 3000 J/kg of CAPE was available.  Wind shear was around 45 kts in the near storm environment.  The freezing level fell during the late afternoon and evening, and sloped from 13,500 feet over the east part of the CWA, to 12,500 over the west.  A line of thunderstorms developed just ahead of the cold front.  Most of the storms produced gusty winds and pea, to a little larger, size hail.  A couple of the storms produced severe hail.  One inch diameter hail fell from one of the storms south of Corning in Adams County.  Another storm dropped one inch diameter hail east of Harcourt in Webster County.  Wind gusts were generally in the 25 to 40 MPH range, with a few reports to around 45 MPH.  Some of the higher gusts were in the Waterloo area, with a 56 MPH wind gust.

As a result, ice jams developed on the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. During the night of Feburary 27 and 28, rainfall  accumulated between one half and one inch and a half across eastern New York. The rains exacerbated the runoff, which resulted in the flooding of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, as well as some smaller streams. Most of the flooding was minor. 
	The Mohawk River exceeded bankful between Utica and Cohoes. The gage at Utica exceeded its flood stage of 403  feet on Feburary 27, crested at 406.4 feet on the 28th, and remained  over  the flood stage for the remainder of the month. At Little Falls, the river went three tenths of a foot  above the 15 foot flood stage. At Cohoes, the river rose two tenths of a foot over the 20 foot stage. The river flooded mainly adjacent lowlands from Utica to Halfmoon. However, forty people were evacuated from their homes in Halfmoon as water encroached upon their homes. Water from the Mohawk overflowed onto a small portion of Route 162 in Montgomery county near Canajoharie and Root, resulting in the roadway being temporarily closed. Flooding was noted along the Hudson-Mohawk bikeway, Canal road, Beach road, Towpath road as well as the parking lot of Schenectady Community College. Fifty residences were evacuated in the Crescent area of southern Saratoga county, some by boat. A few residences were also evacuated on Schaffer drive in Colonie, Albany county.  
	The Hudson River overflowed onto the Mechanicville Wharf and also went over the Mohawk Wharf into the village of Waterford. The village of Warrensburg reported some localized flooding as did the Stillwater Flats.  However, no gages on the Hudson exceeded  their flood stages. 
	The Gilboa Dam barely exceeded its limit of 1132 feet. Excessive water had to be released, which resulted in the Schoharie creek overflowing into Lost Valley and near Burtonsville. 
	The Mettawee river in Washington county crested at 8.7 feet, well over its 7 foot flood stage at Granville. Water from the river inundated several homes in Granville and flooded several roads.
	The Moose River exceeded its 12 foot flood stage at McKeever by four  tenths of one foot. No flooding problems were reported to the National Weather Service. 
	A natural drain clogged in Sharon Springs, Schoharie county resulting in street flooding. Route 20 was flooded and some buildings were damaged.               
	There were no casualties directly related to this flooding, reported to the National Weather Service. ",399196

Of the six homes affected by flood waters and winds, three sustained minor damage.  A state of emergency was declared by the Governor. EPISODE NARRATIVE: Tropical Storm Fay, which came ashore along the northeast Florida coast, moved slowly westward toward the Florida Panhandle from the 22nd through the 24th.  The rainbands from Fay produced sustained winds of 25 to 40 mph with frequent gusts over 45 mph.  These winds downed numerous trees and power lines throughout most of southwest and south central Georgia.  Rainfall amounts associated with the western semicircle of Fay's circulation generally averaged from one to three inches.  However, as Fay moved into the Florida Panhandle on the 23rd, it tapped into Gulf of Mexico moisture, which resulted in excessive rainfall on its east side.  Storm total rainfall during the 48-hour period from noon on the 22nd through the 24th varied from four to as much as 27.50 inches at Thomasville.  Much of this area experienced severe drought conditions, with low streamflows.  Nonetheless, the high volume of runoff resulted in minor to moderate flooding on many of the stem rivers and creeks.  The maximum sustained wind and peak wind measured was at Bainbridge on the 23rd.  The lowest sea-level pressure recorded was 1003 millibars.

On the 8th through 10th high winds around large coastal low pressure system quickly resulted in extreme fire spread in southern Ware and Clinch counties in Southeast Georgia (The Georgia Bugaboo Scrub Fire). The fires combined and raced southward toward Baker and Columbia counties in north Florida becoming the Florida Bugaboo Scrub Fire. Due to close proximity to large populated areas, most significantly Lake City, Florida the fire generated large media attention and became the dominant fire between the two Bugaboo Scrub complexes.  By late on the 8th Georgia State Road 94 and Florida State Road 2 (All one road with two designations) was closed from Moniac, Georgia to Fargo, Georgia due to the threat of the Bugaboo Scrub fire crossing SR 2 and poor visibility because of smoke in the area. By 4:00 p.m. EDT 500 people were evacuated from the vicinity of Taylor, Florida in northern Baker County and others were evacuated near Moniac, Georgia. The focus the fire fighting efforts from May 8th-10th was on structure protection in the Taylor and Baxter, Florida area.  Fire crews, along with private timber companies, were working along the flanks of the fire where conditions allowed, as well as, working to protect structures.  Fire crews and forest industry personnel were also strengthening lines on the southwest edge of the Georgia Bugaboo Scrub near Fargo. The Southern Area Blue Team assumed responsibility of the Florida Bugaboo Scrub Fire, South of State Road 2, on May 10th at 10:00 a.m. EDT. At this point the fire had burned nearly 26,746 acres.

From the 10th through the 13th the fire burned southwest toward Deep Creek and lake City in Columbia County causing evacuations in those areas and sporadic closings of Interstates 10 and 75 in the area. By the 13th the Florida Bugaboo Scrub Fire had burned 102,000 acres, Georgia Bugaboo had burned 131,718 acres and the totals for the two were 233, 718 acres and 570 persons were forced from their homes. Smoke from these large fires produced hazy conditions as far south as Miami over the weekend.  On May 14th, About 4:00 p.m. the fire jumped containment line in the Fairview Road area east of US-441, about five miles north of the Deep Creek community but was contained overnight.  At this time the fire was considered to be 50 percent contained.  Tuesday, May 15th became a critical day for firefighters as winds gusted to 18 mph, with lower humidity and higher temperatures making containing the fire more difficult.  The fire was located about eight miles north of Interstate-10 and 1.5 miles east of U.S. Highway 441.  While no homes were damaged or destroyed, the fire burned to within a mile of the closest homes, which were located on Omar Terrace, about a mile east of U.S. 441 and the Deep Creek community.  At this point there are some 300 homes evacuated, affecting approximately 1,000 people.  48 structural fire units were situated around 350 homes in the immediate area of the fire to prevent loss. By Tuesday evening, the Florida portion of the Bugaboo Fire had increased to a total of 119,501 acres and was 50% contained.

After this point the fire remained within containment with burnout operations continuing around the perimeter through the remainder of the month.

Moisture levels were slightly lower early Saturday but the large scale lift with the approaching disturbance and cooler air aloft allowed for showers to develop after midnight Friday night across interior sections of South Texas.  The rain became locally heavy, again, on the west side of Choke Canyon Reservoir.  Localized rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches occurred bringing 2 day totals of 12 to 18 inches.  Partial sunshine allowed for sufficient heating across the Coastal Bend on the morning of the 17th and low level speed convergence was present early in the morning.  Instability values peaked on Saturday with surface-based CAPE of 2500 to 3000 J/KG.  A weak surface boundary reflection of the upper level trough axis entered the Coastal Plains by early afternoon and thunderstorms became numerous.  At the same time a weak sea breeze shifted slightly inland over the western portions of Kleberg and Nueces Counties.  Increased upper level winds shifted from west to northwest with the arrival of a stronger upper level trough helped organize the thunderstorms which had developed in the very unstable air mass.  By mid afternoon, a line of thunderstorms slowly moved through Jim Wells and Kleberg Counties producing a quick 2 to 5 inches of rain, significant cloud to ground lightning, and a weak EF-0 tornado on the King Ranch.  The heavy rain resulted in additional flooding to parts of Jim Wells County which had already received significant rainfall during the week.EVENT NARRATIVE: Spotter reported a wall clouds and funnel cloud 10 miles northwest of Bishop.",798635

The storm brought both high winds and exceptionally heavy rainfall to eastern New York, which included a large swath of 3 to 6 inch amounts.  A  frontal zone helped concentrate the heaviest rain just to the west of the Hudson Valley in the eastern Catskills and Helderbergs . Locally higher amounts of rainfall, exceeding a foot, fell in these areas. Specific rainfall amounts included  6.12 inches at  Albany International Airport, the highest ever officially recorded from any given storm!  Even higher amounts of rainfall included 8.15 inches in Delmar and 9 inches at Knox, both located in Albany  County. 12.21 inches of rainfall was recorded in Cairo, Greene County, the most associated with the storm! The rain produced widespread flooding across the region, which proved very destructive and in one case, deadly.  A  nine-year-old girl in Wingdale, Dutchess County, drowned attempting to cross a flooded driveway,  which had become a raging torrent. Significant flooding was noted on many smaller tributaries, including the Esopus, Catskill and Schoharie Creeks.  The Normanskill in Albany rose to 13.5 feet, the second highest flood on record badly damaging homes in its vicinity. Coeymans Creek overflowed, forcing evacuation from 20 homes in Selkirk, Albany County.  While the larger rivers did not generally exceed bankfull, heavy runoff pushed raw sewage into the Stockade section of  Schenectady. In addition, rains not only flooded many roadways but washed out portions of them. One of these washouts was on Route 20 in Guilderland, between Willow Street and State  Route 146. Seven families had to be evacuated from homes along Route 32 in Menands, Albany County.  Many communities and counties  declared a State of  Emergency during the overnight of September 16 and 17. The rains, combined with left-over rain from Tropical Storm Dennis, a week earlier, alleviated the fourteen month drought across most of the region. 
	Winds from the passage of Floyd gusted to 49 mph at Albany International Airport during the evening of  September 16. Higher gusts estimated over 60 mph were common across the hilltowns.  The combination of the wind and very saturated ground, produced widespread downing of trees and power lines across much of eastern New York. The Wolf  Pond Valley of  northwest Warren County had wind gusts estimated as high as 80 mph. Hundreds, if not over a thousand trees were downed in a mile-long, 200-yard-wide swath in the narrow valley. Some of the trees fell on vehicles and houses across Eastern New York.  One house was especially damaged in Rhinebeck, Dutchess County. The rain and wind produced massive power outages across the region. As many as 80,000 people lost power in the Mid Hudson Valley region, 54,000 in the Greater Capital District and another 25,000 in the Lake George Saratoga region. Some individuals had to wait over a week for power to be restored. The storm resulted in lost wages , closed schools throughout the region, and cancelled flights at Albany International Airport. 
	Floyd resulted in the counties of Albany, Dutchess ,Greene and Rensselaer  being declared  ""major disaster areas""  by Governor Pataki.

The setting was quite similar to the previous day except much of the activity was driven by synoptic scale dynamics.  A cold front was moving southeast across the state while an upper level wave was traveling east across the state.  The airmass was quite unstable in spite of the limited low level moisture.  Thunderstorms formed over the southern three tiers of Iowa's counties.  The trigger mechanism was a weak boundary settling south ahead of the cold front.  This boundary could be seen clearly on the WSR-88D radar.  Since inflow was much weaker over Iowa than the day before, the storms were not as wide spread.  A cell formed south of Des Moines and expanded into a short line extending southwest.  The new development was to the south and west of the initial cell.  No significant wind was reported with the cells, but hail was common.  Most of the hail reports were in the quarter-size to golf ball-size range.  Union, Wayne, Ringgold, and Decatur Counties were affected by the line.  The time each cell produced significant hail was quite short, on the order of 30 minutes or less.  The storms behaved as pulsar storms with the storm structure quite straight up and down.  Vertically Integrated Liquid values reached a high of 73 Kg-M-2 at the peak of the storms.

EPISODE NARRATIVE: A warm front extended west to east across the Upper Mississippi River Valley on June 7, which provided the focus for thunderstorms producing excessive rainfall and other severe weather. In fact, these storms exhibited very high rainfall rates, which led to 1 to 2 inch rainfall amounts in an hour or so. As the storms congealed into a larger scale line of thunderstorms, they continued to move over the same areas, which led to significant flash flooding through the evening and overnight. 

On June 8, this same warm front lingered across the region, but a cold front approached from the northern Plains. Showers and storms would redevelop during the day in the vicinity of the warm front, while a line of storms developed out ahead of the cold front, with these tracking across the region Sunday night. Again, copious amounts of moisture lead to periods of heavy rain. 

The heavy rainfall on June 8 enhanced the already dangerous flooding conditions across parts of southwest Wisconsin. Many roads were already closed from the June 7 rains due to water over the roadways, mudslides, or partial washouts. Conditions only worsened, leading to more road closures, sandbagging, and some evacuations. 

While the rain was tapering off and moving east Sunday night, June 8, the rivers continued to rise, and some extremely quickly. Some rivers responded with a foot per hour rises, while others eventually exceeded their river gauges ability to record the river levels. These gauges were under water themselves! All-time record crests were set at a few locations, with top 5 records at many others.

Damage to infrastructure and crops was preliminarily estimated at 75 to 85 million dollars. As a result, Crawford, Grant, Juneau, Monroe, Richland and Vernon Counties in central and southwest Wisconsin were declared federal disaster areas.",743274

This system had been slowing moving through the Southern Plains and Midwest in the prior days and had wreaked havoc on that region in the form of many devastating tornadoes, including the EF5 Joplin, Missouri tornado of May 22nd.  As this system spread east, it was weakening in the face of a long standing upper ridge across the southeast U.S. and also moving into a considerably less favorable surface environment.  Nonetheless, it remained a strong upper-level system with decent dynamics.  It brought the most severe weather to the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast office since the historical tornado outbreak of April 27th and 28th.  There were numerous reports of golf ball and larger-sized hail across north Georgia during the afternoon of April 26th which translated mostly into a thunderstorm wind event as the system spread thunderstorm further south across central Georgia during the late evening hours.

Showers and thunderstorms continued during the overnight hours of the 26th and into the early morning hours of the 27th.  By afternoon, the front had pushed into the east central and southeast part of the county warning area.  With afternoon heating and increased instability, thunderstorms increased in intensity and coverage ahead of the front.  Some of these once again became severe.  These were confined to the southeast counties of the county warning area.  Quarter to half-dollar-sized hail was the primary severe weather component of these second round storms.EVENT NARRATIVE: The public reported that at least five trees were down in the county.

EPISODE NARRATIVE: The spring of 2007 started a bit early with the region seeing its first severe weather outbreak on February 24th. A large and powerful storm system took shape as a deep surface low tracked across Kansas and into portions of Iowa. This strong area of low pressure was driven by a powerful upper level trough which supported very strong winds through the entire atmosphere. These winds were felt at the surface to some degree as a large area across the Lower Mississippi River Valley saw sustained winds between 25-35 mph with gusts between 40-50 mph. Those gradient winds, in advance of the severe weather, were strong enough to down some trees and power lines across the region. Those damage reports were more scattered in nature.
Those strong winds from the deepening surface low helped to draw northward moisture and instability. The strong winds allowed for the environment to become highly sheared. Basically, there were increasing winds with height and a change in the wind direction as well. This particular combination of instability and high shear was quite rare. However, this set the stage for a severe weather outbreak which included numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes.",665492

Scattered severe thunderstorms developed over western and central Oklahoma during late afternoon and early evening of the 7th resulting in numerous reports of wind damage and some large hail. In the city of Clinton in Custer County thunderstorm winds toppled a semi-truck trailer at Interstate 40 and South 28th St., ripped apart a camper trailer on Petty Lane, damaged a roof at Washington Elementary and a house in the 1200 block of Avant in Neptune Park. Several mobile homes and house roofs were damaged in Weatherford in Custer County. Damaging winds from another severe thunderstorm 2 miles east of Little in Seminole County downed large limbs from a pecan tree. Large limbs were also blown down near Leedey in Dewey County. Thirteen high line poles and one tree were downed 9 miles southeast of Arnett in Ellis County leaving parts of Arnett without power for 12 hours. An observer in the same location also recorded 3 inches of rain during the storm. As the severe thunderstorm moved north to near Arnett, large limbs were blown off of 2 elm trees. In Caddo County near Eakly, severe thunderstorm winds damaged a school, blew down barns and fences, damaged many other barn roofs, and also blew the roof off from a set of bleachers at the ballpark. The same severe thunderstorm was responsible for ripping a barn roof off and destroying several awnings at a baseball park in Alfalfa, also in Caddo County. In Vici in Dewey County a 300 gallon tank was blown into a nearby house. Lastly, a severe thunderstorm 11 miles east of Buffalo in Harper County lasted for 20 minutes knocking large tree limbs from 2015 CST to 2035 CST.

In addition, the Atlantic City Marina gage (back bay) peaked at 8.7 feet mean lower low water at 1:00 AM EDT on the 12th. Moderate flooding begins at 7.7 feet mean lower low water, except at the Atlantic City Marina gage where there is no established flood stage. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A potent low pressure system in the Ohio Valley during the early morning hours of May 11th moved eastward and gradually weakened. A secondary low formed over northeastern North Carolina during the late afternoon on the 11th and eventually absorbed the other low pressure system, becoming the dominant storm. This storm gradually moved east northeastward late on the 11th into the 12th. Early on the morning of the 12th, the storm was centered over the southern Delmarva. As this storm strengthened fairly rapidly, a strong northeast wind developed and persisted through the evening of the 12th. The prolonged northeasterly flow combined with higher than normal tides, caused moderate tidal flooding and areas of beach erosion in New Jersey. The heaviest rain remained across Delaware and Maryland. By the evening of the 12th, the coastal storm tracked eastward and gradually moved away from the region.

The Nor???easter of May 12th downed trees and wires, and flooded streets in dozens of beach towns. Tidal flooding forced the closure of schools and roads in parts of coastal New Jersey on the 12th and 13th. In Stafford (Ocean County), a truck that was buffeted by the winds got stuck on the Route 72 causeway bridge and blocked traffic. In Ocean County, widespread problems were reported from Stafford Township to Bass River Township due to downed power lines and trees on the 12th, most of which were considered nuisances and annoyances. Minor flooding, which in some cases resulted in road closures were reported. High winds caused the Route 72 Bridge to be closed for an extended period of time late in the morning on the 12th. The bridge was reopened shortly after 4:00 PM EDT on the 12th. Across the island, high winds brought down utility lines and sent debris flying. A billboard for a local ReMax real estate office on East Bay Avenue in Stafford Township was shredded on the 12th due to winds topping nearly 70 mph. In Barnegat Township (Ocean County), nearly 20 trees in various spots of town were knocked down, however there were no power outages or injuries reported. Bayshore Drive was shut down as bay water inundated it in the portion by the public beach and the municipal dock. A tree, which fell on Lower Shore Road, closed that road near the recreation complex. Bay Beach and the municipal dock parking lot were under a foot-and-a-half of water. Some of the older homes reportedly lost some roof shingles as one resident reported them laying in their yard. The strong winds even blew the shopping carts from the Genuardi's supermarket onto West Bay Avenue. 

In Surf City (Ocean County), the Causeway Bridge was closed by authorities from midday to about 5:00 PM EDT on the 12th when the winds approached 65 mph. A truck actually got stuck on the bridge as the driver could not control the drift of the vehicle. The flood-prone and low-lying Tuckerton Beach (Ocean County) experienced increased tides due to the coastal storm, which flooded some areas, and at least two cars were lost. During the morning of the 12th, residents awoke to three feet of water around their homes. There were portable toilets on their sides and floating in the middle of the street, and numerous 20-pound propane tanks also floated around. The strong winds also brought down a couple of power lines and blew a boat off of a boatlift. Some homes lost their siding while others had lost roof shingles. In Beach Haven (Ocean County), the high tide and strong onshore winds allowed water to breach over the street entrance off of Merivale and Nelsen Avenues. On the Bayfront, the water had cleared over some of the bulkheads at Taylor Avenue. The usual flooding occurred along some of the side streets off of Bay Avenue.

Some downed trees were also reported with one downed tree near the intersection of Third and St. Claire avenues, which caused the road to be temporarily closed. Avon-by-the-sea beaches had sand pushed back towards the boardwalk, and crews used front-end loaders to try and spread the sand across the beachfront after the storm passed. Sea Bright (Monmouth County) experienced flooding on the 12th as strong winds and high tides occurred. Approximately 3,000 Jersey Central Power and Light customers in northern Monmouth County lost power in the storm. The strong winds, coupled with the rain, had loosened up some of the tree branches, which then fell onto electrical equipment, according to the power company.

A newly purchased cell phone was within reach and she was able to summon help to extricate her from the now uninhabitable dwelling. The tree killed a kitten that she had rescued during June flooding. Another cat was injured. The fire department that has jurisdiction could not reach the house due to other fallen trees blocking the route, thus others had to called in. EPISODE NARRATIVE: During the early- to mid-evening hours, the Storm Prediction Center upgraded central, and much of southern, Indiana to a moderate risk for severe weather and issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the area effective until 3 AM EST.

This intensifying low produced a large area of strong low-level winds, both ahead of and behind the cold front.  Winds between 70 - 80 MPH were present just a few thousand feet off the surface across the area by the mid-afternoon hours.  As showers formed during the day, these strong winds were occasionally brought down to the surface.  To further complicate matters, by the late afternoon hours enough instability was present to produce a line of severe thunderstorms along the main cold front as it entered east central Ohio.  This combination of strong gradient winds and severe thunderstorm winds produced widespread damage across the area, mostly in the form of downed trees and power lines.   These high winds continued after the cold frontal passage, downing trees and power lines, until the early morning hours of the 10th.  At that time, the surface low moved off into Quebec and the strong gradient winds finally diminished.  It is estimated that around 15,000 people were left without electricity in east central Ohio in the wake of this wind event.  ",471219

Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas. 
Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma. Given the potent combination of ingredients in place, storms began to produce tornadoes quickly after initiation. Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.

During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.

The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.

During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.

More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic. 

By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher giEVENT NARRATIVE: ",807604

NOAA reported that 12 to 15 inches of rain was needed across north Texas to bring the Palmer Drought Severity Index back to near normal values.  Spring rainfall continued to lack, increasing rainfall deficits since January 2006 to anywhere from a couple of inches to almost nine inches in some locations.  Temperatures also remained quite warm, and the National Climatic Data Center reported that the first half of the year was the warmest ever on record for the U.S.  They also reported that Texas in particular was warmer than average for the period.  Disaster declarations remained in place for Collin, Comanche, Parker, and Somervell Counties due to the drought.  Warm temperatures, plenty of dry fuel, and the ongoing drought continued to present dangerous wildfire opportunities.  Outdoor burn bans remained in place for many north Texas Counties.

The hydrologic drought continued to affect area lakes.  Lake Lewisville was over 8 feet below normal this month, and Lake Lavon was almost 11 feet below normal.  Bridgeport, Hubbard Creek, and Jim Chapman reservoirs were all more than 10 feet below normal pool elevation.  Beginning June 1, Fort Worth and Arlington imposed mandatory water restrictions between 10 AM and 6 PM daily.  The North Texas Municipal Water District, which serves 1.5 million people in Collin, Dallas, Denton, Hunt, Kaufman, and Rockwall Counties, began Stage 3 water restrictions this month, which allows residents to water their lawns only once a week.  The city of Lavon in Collin County stopped allowing residents to fill new swimming pools as a result of the water shortage.

The drought remained a problem for the agricultural sector as well.  Recent data showed that wheat production in Texas was down 64% from last year, and oat production was down 18%.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture approved Governor Rick Perry's request for drought relief in several counties, including Hamilton, Johnson, and McLennan. Farmers and ranchers in these counties were eligible for low-interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency.

The current U.S. seasonal outlook through September 2006 forecasts drought conditions over north Texas to persist or intensify, with marginal improvement possible in areas of southeastern north Texas.",640975

Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon over the western sections of south central Texas and moved east and northeast. A few storms produced dime to golf ball hail after 1800 CST, mainly along a line from western Coryell county, through central Bosque county, to eastern Johnson, and then north-northeast from Midlothian (Ellis county) across Dallas to Garland, where it diminished shortly after 2100 CST. Thunderstorms moved east across southern Navarro county late in the day.

At the surface a warm frontal boundary extended nearly east to west across the state and provided the focus for thunderstorm development.  By the late afternoon, lifted indices were approaching -10 C. with CAPE values around 5000 J/kg over western Iowa.  Surface temperatures warmed into the upper 80s with dew points in the low to mid 70s.  A southwest surface wind of 15 to 25 kts pushed over the front.  Northeast of the frontal boundary winds were easterly around 10 to 15 kts.  Actually, the surface boundary was further enhanced by outflow from convective complexes during the day, further sharpening the contrast.  Thunderstorms continued to fire along and north of the boundary through the afternoon and into the evening.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding as very heavy rains fell on areas that had had significant rainfall the previous night.  There were reports in north central into northeast Iowa of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in a little more than an hours time.  Major flooding took place in the Mason City area where evacuations were taking place.  The thunderstorms became most intense during the afternoon into the early evening.  There were several tornadoes across northeast into north central Iowa.  Most were relatively brief touchdowns and were in open areas.  Reports of multi-vortex tornadoes were received from Grundy County.  The days most significant tornado touched down in Pocahontas County east of Rolfe and tracked into Humboldt County through the Bradgate area.  The tornado damaged or destroyed over 75% of the town of Bradgate (pop 120).  Tornado damage in Bradgate was very extensive impacting most of the town.  Hardly a building was not impacted.   Outbuildings, light structures and garages were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Two homes were destroyed.  Several homes were damaged ranging from minor to extensive.  The Survey Team found that the majority of the damage was F1, with a few cases of F2 damage.  The F2 damage was to the snapping of very large trees just west of town and the structural damage to two buildings.  Nearly all of the 53 homes there reported damage with several totally destroyed.  Significant widespread property damage was reported in the tornadoes path.  There were several injuries in the town, the most significant being a broken leg.  A police officer was reportedly hit by debris from the tornado and suffered a broken leg.  According to law officials, the damage path of the tornado was 2 miles wide and about 8 miles long.  Storm chasers on the scene reported the tornado itself to be one half mile wide at one point.  Reports of hail were numerous through the afternoon and evening.  Most of the hail was in the three quarter inch to one inch diameter range.  There were a few reports of golf ball size hail from the stronger storms.  Winds were not a major problem with the activity.  There were spotty reports of winds to around 60 MPH, but most reports were in the 40 to 50 MPH range.  One of the stronger wind reports was a 64 MPH wind gust in Tripoli in Bremer County.  This gust was measured by a mesonet station there.  During the mid evening hours, thunderstorms rumbled across Grundy County.  Lightning struck the Sheriff's office there and destroyed a significant amount of office equipment.

Severe flooding in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, MC)xico from June 30th through July 2nd, from an estimated 30 inches of rain in this area was a portent of future impacts on the Rio Grande during the weeks to come.

Releases of water from reservoirs behind dams on both sides of the border began soon after the heaviest rains from Alex ended. On July 4th, releases began at the Marte R. Gomez Reservoir, flowing into Mexican Floodways but also toward the Rio Grande bordering Starr and western Hidalgo County. On July 5th, water levels had increased sufficiently at Amistad Dam, located much farther upstream near Del Rio, Texas, to begin releases down the river. By the 7th, with waters from Amistad having created major flooding in and near Laredo, Falcon Reservoir, located along the Rio Grande including Starr and Zapata County, began releasing water. The initial rate of 15,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) was initially within capacity of the United States side of the flood control system, and the expectation for a potentially critical flood area between Falcon and Anzalduas Reservoir just upstream from Mission (Hidalgo County) was high water, but little if any flooding. 

That would quickly change on July 8th, when releases from Falcon Dam were more than doubled to 39,700 cfs (1125 cubic meters per second, cms). Soon after, the river surged to major flood levels in Starr and extreme southwestern Hidalgo County, where the river widened significantly and flooded rangeland, as well as seEVENT NARRATIVE: Incredible rainfall estimated to be more than 50 inches in around 10 days' time between June 30th and July 9th across the front range and peaks of the Sierra Madre Oriental in Coahuila Province, Mexico, ultimately flowed through the entire Lower Rio Grande basin for much of the summer of 2010. 

Nearly a month of dam releases from Falcon International Reservoir at 60,000 cfs ultimately required water to be diverted at Anzalduas Dam (southwest of Granjeno) into Mexico and the U.S. Floodway system, which includes the North Floodway which curves east across northwest Cameron County just south of Sebastian.  

These floodways, protected by a robust system of levees and gates, protected communities outside of the levees by containing up to 50%, or 4 to 8 to feet, of fast flowing water, within them.  In Cameron County, there were no reports of structural damage as the North Floodway tracks in largely uninhabited country.  However, several paved and unpaved roads were flooded inside the levees, including the Federal Highway 77 (Expressway) frontage road (the Expressway was well above the water level), County Road 506, and FM 1425 (along the Cameron/Hidalgo County line) 

Crops may have been destroyed by the flood along North Floodways, but damage in northwest Cameron County was unknown as of this writing.  Infrastructure damage to roads and low water bridges may have exceeded [$x] thousand in northwestern Cameron County.",820327

The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan).

EPISODE NARRATIVE: An intense fall cyclone developed over the region and produced an episode of severe weather which included tornadoes. This strong weather system developed as a very strong jet stream, with winds between 160-200 mph, slammed into Oregon and Washington State. All that energy moved over the Rocky Mountains and caused a strong area of surface low pressure to develop. This low intensified as it moved east across the Red River Valley and then lifted across Arkansas and into Tennessee as it deepened to 990 mb! The strength of this deepening low caused warm and unstable air to lift northward across Louisiana and into central Mississippi. It was this northward moving warm front that became the focus of an area where tornadic supercell thunderstorms could thrive in an unstable and highly sheared environment.
This large and powerful storm system produced numerous tornadoes across the south and south eastern United States where many were of the strong (F2 or F3) variety. Within the Jackson, MS forecast area, there were a total of 5 tornadoes to impact the counties serviced. Two F3s, one in Lamar County and the other in Jones County. The Jones County tornado actually contained a satellite tornado, F1, which briefly rotated around the parent tornado. Next was an F1 tornado in southern Marion County which was actually the end of a strong tornado that moved out of Walthall County. Lastly, a brief F1 tornado occurred in central Lamar County. Tornadoes were not the only type of severe weather, scattered wind damage also occurred across northeast Louisiana and portions of central Mississippi between midnight and 10 am Wednesday November 15th 2006.",623314

A  second low pressure system formed along the South Carolina Coast the morning of the 29th and intensified rapidly as it moved northward and became the main low pressure system.  The low moved inland along the New Jersey shore the night of the 29th and entered the state close to the Little Egg Harbor Inlet and proceeded north along the coastal counties.  By 7 a.m. EST on the 30th it was located in southern Vermont.

This low pressure system brought heavy rain to a large part of the state, high winds to Monmouth and Ocean Counties as it was intensifying and some minor tidal flooding at the times of the evening high tide on the 29th.  The heavy rain in most places coincided with the incoming tide and this exacerbated the poor drainage flooding along the coastal communities.  

In the New Jersey coastal counties, in Monmouth County,  the heavy rain caused the collapse of a home in the Stonehurst Development in Freehold Township.  The basement wall gave in and the home was deemed uninhabitable.  The combination of the heavy rain and tides caused flooding and road closures in Highlands, Keyport, Monmouth Beach,  Port Monmouth, Sea Bright and Union Beach.  Union Beach was one of the harder hit communities with barricades all over town.  In Hazlet, the heavy rain forced the closure of sections of New Jersey State Route 36.  In Ocean County, the tides and heavy rain forced the closure of several main roadways and one traffic circle in Long Beach Township, Ship Bottom and Surf City.  In addition to the heavy rain and tides, wind gusts reached around 60 mph and knocked down trees and power lines.  Part of a 90-foot-tall tree fell on top of a unit of the Bayview Condominium in Highlands (Monmouth County).  Numerous power lines were reported down in Long Branch (Monmouth County).  GPU Energy reported about 6,300 homes and businesses lost power from Middletown Township in Monmouth County south through Toms River in Ocean County.  Peak wind gusts included 61 mph in Brighton Beach and 57 mph in Harvey Cedars (both in Ocean County).  Farther south along the shore, the rain was not as heavy (especially in Cape May County) and did not coincide as well with the high tide.  The highest tides that evening included 6.9 feet above mean low water in Cape May, 6.4 feet above mean low water in Atlantic City, 5.2 feet above mean low water in Sea Bright and 3.1 feet above mean low water in Ship Bottom on Manahawkin Bay.  Tidal departures were between 2.1 and 2.8 feet above normal at the times of high tide.  

Heavy rain also fell throughout a large part of the state, particularly during the evening of the 29th.  Storm totals averaged around 2.00 inches and caused the typical urban and poor drainage flooding.  Hardest hit were the Raritan Basin counties of Hunterdon, Middlesex and Somerset.  Several streets ""notorious"" for flooding in those counties were closed, but the main stem rivers stayed within their banks.  Storm totals included 2.8 inches in Lakehurst (Ocean County), 2.73 inches in Margate (Atlantic County), 2.1 inches in New Lisbon (Burlington County), 2.08 inches in Iselin (Middlesex County), 1.96 inches in Freehold (Monmouth County), 1.77 inches in Boonton (Morris County), 1.69 inches in Hightstown (Mercer County), 1.6 inches in Belle Mead (Somerset County) and Wertsville (Hunterdon County).  Storm totals from Camden County south were generally under an inch.

The gap favored wind areas, such as Judith Gap and Livingston, which are accustomed to strong winds of 60 to 75 mph occuring a couple times a year, experienced wind gusts to 85 mph. This resulted in power being knocked out to the town of Livingston. Winds over 100 mph were recorded at the Stillwater Mine near Nye. In Nye, local news reports quoted local residents indicating wind gusts in excess of 120 mph at times. Extensive damage was done to the area including tree and power pole damage, roofs blown off houses, barns destroyed, and car and home windows being blown out. 

In addition to the direct wind damage caused by this event, wind driven fires possibly sparked by downed power lines engulfed large chunks of land during the evening of the 12th.

Summary of events for May 3-4 1999:

Following a week-long blocking weather pattern, a strong upper level trough finally moved out of the southwestern U.S. Interactions with a dryline in western Oklahoma and a slow-moving cold front brought the largest tornado outbreak in Oklahoma history from the afternoon of May 3 through the afternoon of May 4.  Most notable was the F5 tornado that moved through southern parts of the Oklahoma City metro area.  While the loss of life and the heaviest property damage was limited to central Oklahoma, eastern Oklahoma got into the act with a significant number of tornadoes.

While there were dozens of individual storms on May 3 and 4, there are two storms in eastern Oklahoma that stand out as outstanding.  The first outstanding storm moved northeast along the I-44 corridor on the evening of May 3, causing F3 damage to Stroud in Lincoln County.  The storm went on to cause significant F1 damage in Sapulpa and southwestern portions of the city of Tulsa and millions of dollars in damage.

The second outstanding storm got its start in southeast Oklahoma well south of McAlester.  This storm moved northeast across Pushmataha, Latimer, Haskell, LeFlore and Sequoyah Counties, producing several damaging tornadoes along the way.  The final tornado touched down in Sequoyah County and tracked 39 miles to near Fayetteville, AR, producing F3 damage in an unpopulated forest in Adair County.

Following a very wet April that saturated area grounds, another slow-moving weather system made flash flooding another serious problem to deal with as most rainfall quickly ran off into creeks, streams and mainstem rivers.  One flash flood in Vinita caused millions of dollars in damage following the flooding of dozens of homes.",368912

Accumulations averaged 6 to 8 inches, but there was a swath of one foot snows along the New Jersey Turnpike corridor from Gloucester County northeast through Middlesex County.  The least snow accumulated in Warren and Sussex Counties where 3 to 5 inches fell.  This storm helped set several SEASONAL SNOWFALL RECORDS within and around the state.  New Brunswick (Seasonal Total to date 63.7 inches.),  Trenton (58.9 inches),  Philadelphia (55.9 inches),  New Castle County Airport (53.8 inches) and Pomona (45.5 inches) all set new seasonal snowfall records.  Individual accumulations included 15 inches in Swedesboro, 13 inches in Bordentown and Mount Laurel, 12 inches in Berlin, 11.5 inches in Woodbridge, 11 inches in Hammonton and Folsom, 10 inches in Mount Holly, 9 inches in New Brunswick, 8 inches in Ewing and Millville, 7 inches in Belle Mead, Budd Lake  and Wertsville, 6.5 inches in Pomona/Atalntic City International Airport, 6 inches in Long Valley, Estelle Manor, Toms River and Howell, 5 inches in Newton and 3 inches in Belvidere.    

Unlike the previous snow storms this winter, this one's timing during the Friday of an upcoming three day weekend was not good.  Other snow storms this winter either occurred on the weekend or were nasty enough by the morning commute to keep most people at home and schools closed.  In the Philadelphia area travel was described as the worst  of the year.  There were 17 accidents alone in Dover Township (Ocean County), and 15 fender benders in Trenton.  A seven vehicle accident closed the southbound truck lanes of the New Jersey Turnpike for more than two hours in Middlesex County.  This led to a 10 mile back-up.  There were a half dozen other accidents on the Turnpike, about a dozen accidents on Interstates 287 and 80 and several spinouts on the Garden State Parkway.  Service was suspended on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry.  ",265490

In Bowie, numerous homes, porches, sheds, cars, and fences were damaged.  Over 60 dump truck loads of debris were removed from the city following the storm.  So many trees came down on the Whitemarsh Park nature trail that it was closed for weeks. In addition, damage was reported in Lanham, Hyattsville, Bladensburg, and Beltsville where a 78 MPH gust was recorded. A power line was downed onto the Capitol Beltway in Greenbelt and electrified a guard rail which led to the closure of the road for several hours.  Penny sized hail fell in Brandywine.  In Charles County, trees and power lines were downed in Bryantown.  Penny to quarter sized hail fell in Ironsides and penny sized hail was reported in Waldorf.  In Calvert County, numerous trees and power lines were felled. The hardest hit communities included Dunkirk and North Beach.  In St. Mary's County, power poles were downed in Wicomico Shores.

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, EVENT NARRATIVE: The Catoosa County 911 Center reported that several trees and power lines were down in the extreme northwest part of the county, near Fort Oglethorpe and Lakeview.",857236

However, well to the north of Karl, a very moist tropical air mass resided and became the focus for a significant rainfall event. This rain event resulted in record flooding on Oso Creek in Corpus Christi, one flash flood fatality, and the flooding of numerous streets, homes, and vehicles along the immediate Texas coastline.

On Sunday September 19th, a low pressure trough developed along the mid Texas coast and interacted with an upper level disturbance which focused the heaviest rainfall over Corpus Christi, Sinton, and Rockport. The heaviest rains occurred between 900 AM and 300 PM Sunday in which up to 7 inches of rain was recorded. These heavy rains caused widespread street flooding and road closures in Aransas, San Patricio, Nueces, and Kleberg Counties. Many homes in Corpus Christi were flooded, especially in the neighborhoods near the intersection of Holly and Greenwood. On Monday September 20th, another 1 to 2 inches of rainfall were recorded.

Runoff from these heavy rains flowed into Oso Creek, which runs along the southwest edge of Corpus Christi. The only gaging site on Oso Creek, located on FM 763 about 2 miles west of town, recorded a rapid rise up to 28 feet on Sunday, before it stopped working. A post storm survey conducted by the National Weather Service and United States Geological Survey confirmed the creek crested at 30.62 feet around 805 AM Monday morning which beat the previous record of 29.37 feet set back on August 10th, 1980 during Hurricane Allen.EVENT NARRATIVE: FM 1069 from State Highway 188 to Business 35 is closed due to high water.",833389

A warm front lifted north across the state during the previous day, allowing a strong surge of moisture to flow north from the Gulf of Mexico.  Temperatures rose into the 70s to low 80s as surface dew point temperatures rose into the upper 50s and 60s across the state.  By the early evening hours, a frontal boundary extended from near Sioux City east-northeast into the northeast corner of the state.  Thunderstorms fired along this front and became severe during the evening.  These storms produced very heavy rain with numerous reports of hail.  For the most part, the hail was around an inch in diameter with the storms.  There were a few reports of hail up to the size of golf balls however.  Reports of golf ball size hail were received from the Ringsted area of Emmet County, and also from the Fraser area of Boone County.   Two things were taking place during the evening.  While the thunderstorms were firing along the warm front over northern Iowa, a strong low pressure system was racing out of Colorado.  CAPE values across northeast Kansas into Iowa were in the 2000 to 3000 J/Kg range as a dry line extending south from the low approached the area.  Strong thunderstorms developed over northeast Colorado and raced east across Nebraska and Kansas.  The thunderstorms took on a bow echo configuration as they headed across the Plains at more than 60 MPH.   High winds raked Nebraska and Kansas before moving into Iowa.  There were numerous reports of winds of 60 to 80 MPH as the line advanced across the west half of Iowa with numerous reports of trees and power lines downed.  As the storms moved through Carroll County, several outbuildings were destroyed in the Templeton area.  Machine sheds were totally destroyed in Adair County by the high winds.  Further northwest, in Greene County, a barn was flattened north of Scranton.  Damage continued as the storms continued east with reports of outbuildings damaged or destroyed toward Hamilton County. One of the most damaging events of the night took place late in the storm cycle.  The storms turned into wind producers.  High winds hit the Lake Mills area in Winnebago County for example.  A barn and several sheds were destroyed by the winds around 80 MPH.   As the storms moved into Hardin County, a microburst occurred west of the Iowa Falls area with winds estimated around 85 MPH.  A tornado touched down briefly in the community of Alden, causing considerable damage in the town.  The tornado touched down in two locations of the town, damaging several buildings four blocks apart.    Concrete blocks were picked up and thrown 50 to 75 yards and roofs of the affected buildings were strewn one quarter to three eighths of a mile downstream.  One business was damages with estimated damage around $180,000.  On a farm at the edge of town damage was estimated at $100,000.  Numerous trees were downed on Highways 491 and D15, blocking travel in the area.  Shortly after this event occurred, the storms weakened and continued moving northeast.",421677

These storms at times produced the full gamut of severe weather, including large hail, damaging winds, tornadoes and flooding. Portions of Marion, Harvey, Butler, Sedgwick and McPherson counties were especially affected by straight-line damaging winds, as a pair or bow echoes surged east to northeast across the area, inflicting damage to numerous barns, outbuildings and some other structures, uprooting trees and downing power poles. Additionally, a handful of relatively weak, short-lived tornadoes skipped across portions of Sumner, Cowley, Butler, Marion and Sedgwick counties during the afternoon and evening hours on the 25th and 26th. A tornado near Lake Afton in southwest Sedgwick county inflicted moderate damage to a residence, and also injured two people. Furthermore, heavy thunderstorms training over the same areas produced widespread areal flooding, river flooding and flash flooding across mainly south-central, east-central and southeast Kansas. Numerous rural and city roads were flooded and subsequently closed due to high water. Various water rescues were needed for stranded motorists, as well as homeowners threatened by flood waters. Numerous homes and businesses were flooded, along with the Cowley County Fairgrounds. Sadly, three flooding deaths occurred, one in Greenwood county and two in Labette county. Some injuries occurred as well.EVENT NARRATIVE: Winds were estimated at 60 to 70 mph.",756401

EPISODE NARRATIVE: An unseasonably strong upper level storm system and deep surface low pressure (with central pressure as low as 979 mb) interacted with a cold front that moved from west to east across the area during the late afternoon and evening.  A moist and unstable airmass ahead of the cold front provided the fuel to generate severe thunderstorms that included five tornadoes, near record-size hail and damaging winds.  Thousands of homes sustained damage and about 15,000 customers lost power during the storms, some for almost 3 days as trees blocked roads and slowed repair work to power lines.  Four people sustained minor injuries, and total damage from the storms exceeded $60 million.

The first tornado of the outbreak moved across eastern Marathon County shortly after 4:00 PM CDT, producing damage to several homes.  The tornado was rated EF2.

A second thunderstorm produced a weak tornado in Wood County, which was rated EF0.  The same storm responsible for this tornado produced softball size hail that damaged thousands of homes, several businesses and hundreds of vehicles.  One hailstone that fell in Port Edwards measured 5.50 inches in diameter, making it the second largest hailstone on record in Wisconsin.

The same supercell thunderstorm that produced the Marathon County tornado also produced a long-track tornado across northeast Shawano, northwest Menominee, southeast Langlade and northern Oconto counties.  This tornado was on the ground for 47 minutes, covering 40.1 miles, and destroyed 14,400 acres of woodlands (timber loss was estimated at $12.5 million) and dozens of buildings along its path.  The twister, which was over one-half mile at times, was rated EF3, with peak winds estimated of 150 to 160 mph.  The storm responsible for the tornado also produced significant straight-line wind damage as it moved into western Marinette County.  

The fourth tornado of the outbreak, rated EF1, developed near Cedarville in Marinette Co., which was from the same thunderstorm that produced the long-track tornado. 

The final tornado of the afternoon and evening touched down near Harmony in Marinette Co.  This tornado was rated EF1.

A cold front extended south from the low into Kansas.  South of the warm front, dew point temperatures were in the low 70s.  A speed max passed to the northwest of the state, placing Iowa in the right rear entrance region of the speed max.  This set the stage for thunderstorm development.  A strong low level jet was in place with speeds in excess of 50 knots.  Initially, a small like of strong, but not severe, thunderstorms formed from southwest into north central Iowa.  As the morning progressed, the storms initially produced hail of three quarters inch up to golf ball in size.  The hail event quickly turned into a wind event as the storms accelerated along the line.  Wind damage was widespread.  A roof was taken off of a house in Des Moines as one of the cells moved through.  A later storm took a roof off of a building in West Des Moines later in the morning.  Wind damage was also significant in Webster and Hamilton Counties as the storms moved through.  Numerous reports of sheds blown over were received.  Some of the pieces from the sheds were found over a mile downwind.  A school roof was 40 percent removed in Blairsburg by high winds.  Damage to the building was placed at $150,000.  The next problem was with the storms training over the same areas.  The cells moved northeast along the line with little eastward progress of the line itself.  This caused urban and small stream flooding over a several county area as widespread rainfall of one to two inches occurred in several central Iowa counties.  The situation became more serious in a several county area.  Rainfall of three to five inches was recorded in parts of Dallas, Madison, Polk, Story, and Warren Counties.  This resulted in flash flooding as all creeks and streams swelled over their banks.  The situation became very serious in the larger cities.  In Des Moines, a state of emergency was declared as water of 6 feet or greater in depth choked many of the city intersections.  Hundreds of cars were stalled in the streets and many basements were flooded.  Between the high winds and water, electricity was knocked out to 15000 homes in Des Moines during the height of the storm.  Damage estimates were in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in all of the flash flood counties, and over one million dollars in Polk County, where the Governor declared a state disaster.  A disaster declaration was also made for Dallas County.  Reports indicated that in the Des Moines metropolitan area, up to 10,000 homes had water in the basement.  The city of Des Moines reported that infrastructure losses alone around $1 million.  Crop damage estimates from this event, combined with the event of just a few days earlier, totalled around $100 million.  During the early afternoon hours, the cold front over Nebraska began moving east, resulting in a change in the thunderstorm configuration.  Several bow echo elements formed along the line which caused another round of high winds and also began shifting the line east.  From Des Moines east, numerous places reported winds of 60 to 75 MPH, along with considerable damage.  Seventy two MPH winds buffeted Grinnell in Poweshiek County, breaking out windows in homes there.  Winds approached 85 MPH west of Montezuma causing extensive damage on several farms there.  Two semi-tractortrailor trucks were blown off of I-380 southeast of Waterloo in Black Hawk County.  The highest wind reported was in Tama County, at Montour where 90 MPH winds struck the city, resulting in widespread damage.  One tornado touched down south of Des Moines.  The tornado was small and rain wrapped and produced an intermittent track of minor damage from near Martensdale to northeast of Norwalk in Warren County.  Scattered thunderstorms formed ahead of the main area of thunderstorms during the late morning hours.  Initially, they were not severe, but one did produce a lightning stroke in Grinnell that touched off a minor fire in a house there.  ",319784

At the same time, a large MCS developed over northern Nebraska and tracked east into southern Minnesota into northern Iowa.  The airmass was quite unstable over Iowa and favorable for elevated convection as the system moved in.  CAPE values remained in the 2000 to 3500 J/kg range along and south of the boundary with lifted indices in the -8 range.  The environment was quite strongly sheared with 50 to 60 kts of shear.

This storm produced a large amount of baseball sized hail and even some stones up to the size of softballs between Solomon and Abilene.  Some of the storms had strong rotation and one storm produced a funnel cloud near Agenda. Aside from the significant hail and brief funnels, these storms were slow moving and brought torrential rain which has caused significant flooding to Manhattan, Louisville, Ogden, and Morganville. The storms which caused the flooding brought between 6 and 9 inches of rain over a 6 hour period to Clay, Riley, Pottawatomie, and Dickinson counties. In Manhattan the Red Bud Estates was completely inundated with running water from Wildcat Creek. Rock Creek in Louisville rose out of its banks and flooded some residences along Highway 99.

South of this front, the air mass was becoming increasingly warm, moist and unstable.  Meanwhile, aloft, a low amplitude, yet vigorous short wave embedded within a fast zonal flow, was tracking rapidly eastward from the mid south into the southeast.  Strong shear and high helicity combined with the unstable air mass and the frontal boundary to allow repeated severe thunderstorms to develop and track eastward along the boundary across north Georgia.  The activity began early in the day as a complex of thunderstorms moved into the area from Alabama and continued until nearly midnight.  As the day progressed, especially during the afternoon, the development of the activity gradually progressed further south and by midnight had reached the south and southeast parts of the state.  Numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadic supercells were observed throughout the day.

Snow first spread across west central Lower Michigan during mid afternoon Friday, then spread east-southeast across southwest, central, and south central during the early evening hours. Southwest winds blowing across Lake Michigan ahead of the system resulted in lake enhancement across much of west central Lower Michigan, including Ottawa, Muskegon, Oceana, Mason, Lake, Newaygo, Kent, and Osceola Counties. Gusty winds associated with the system, first southwest ahead of the front, then northwest behind it, resulted in blowing and drifting. Wind speeds were sustained at 15 to 25 mph, with gusts to 35 mph. Snowfall rates approached 1 inch per hour with this system and total accumulations ranged from 2.5 to 10 inches in the listed counties. Snow accumulations south of Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, and Lansing were 2 inches or less. 
	The timing of the onset of heavy snow across the Muskegon - Grand Rapids - Holland metropolitan area coincided with the Friday afternoon rush hour. Numerous weather-related accidents were reported, many of which involved minor injuries.

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.",533754

A strong upper level system intensified over the central U.S. from the 10th into the 11th.  Surface low pressure developed to the west of Iowa, and moved east into northwest Iowa by the early morning of the 11th.  The low continued across the north half of Iowa on the 11th, reaching Lower Michigan by mid day on the 12th.  Initially, the storm was quite moisture starved.  As it intensified, the dynamics of the storm strengthened the inflow, feeding the storm system.  The presentation on satellite imagery was classic by the morning of the 11th with a clear dry slot and deformation zone present.  The dry slot punched into southwest and central Iowa with a line of showers and isolated thunderstorms firing up on the leading edge of the dry slot.  Cold air rushed in on the back side of the storm.  The deformation zone curled around the back side of the low and produced moderate to occasionally heavy snow.  Temperatures plummeted as strong northwest winds swept across the state.  Blizzard conditions developed as winds increased to sustained winds of 30 to 45 MPH, with gusts to near 70 MPH at times.   Some of the higher gusts included a 71 MPH gust in Audubon, 65 MPH gust at Farnhamville and on the mile long bridge across Saylorville Reservoir, 64 MPH at Adair and Boone, 63 MPH at Carroll, 61 MPH at Creston, 60 MPH at Algona, and 59 MPH at Ankeny and Windsor Heights.  The winds caused whiteout conditions over western Iowa by the mid afternoon hours.  Boone County declared a Civil Emergency as travel became impossible in the county.  Nearly all roads were closed in the northwest quarter of the state, with travel not recommended over nearly all of the Des Moines CWA.  Interstate 80 was closed for several hours from the Nebraska border to just west of Des Moines.  Many of the counties across the northwest half of Iowa had to removeEVENT NARRATIVE: ",839127

Surface conditions became increasingly unstable during the afternoon with temperatures in the 80s and dewpoints in the 60s and lower 70s. More importantly, an unseasonably strong mid-atmospheric shortwave and winds aloft tracked across this region as well, which allowed for thunderstorms to develop rapidly, intensify and maintain longevity.

During the afternoon and evening, scattered to numerous thunderstorms developed traveled across northern New York and through Vermont. Several storms strengthened into supercells that produced widespread wind damage to trees, power poles and structures as well as large hail in excess of golf ball size in diameter.

Some of the communities largely affected were Milton, Colchester, Essex, Jericho, Stowe, Brookfield, Chelsea and Rutland. In addition, very heavy localized rains caused some temporary problems in many communities, but did result in washed out roads, culverts in Chelsea.EVENT NARRATIVE: Several large branches/limbs downed by thunderstorm winds near the intersection of Routes 7 and 127.

Thunderstorms ravaged a large part of south central Nebraska with hail, high winds, a tornado and catastrophic flooding.

During evening and early morning hours, 4 to 12 inches of fell from Dawson County east to York County. At Kenesaw and Wood River, over 11 inches of rain was measured. The city of Grand Island set a rainfall record for a single event with 7.21 inches of rain. Statically, this event was a 100 year rain and flood event for the area. 
	
In Wood River, 12 people were evacuated due to rising water. It was estimated every structure in Wood River sustained some sort of storm damage and wave after wave of severe thunderstorms pounded the town. Twelve homes sustained severe damage. The Wood River crested at 9 feet in town and flooding most streets.  Thirty-six homes were evacuated in the city of Grand Island as flooding was rampant over the west and north part of the city. The city's sewer system handled about 75 million gallons of water, or about 6 times the normal amount during the storm. Many parts of the business and residential districts sustained flood damage as the Prairie, Silver and Moores Creeks flooded. The Wood River near Alda, which had been dry for three years, tied a record with a crest of 12.2 feet early on the 12th. Elsewhere, three miles of roads were washed out in Kearney County and 15 miles of roads were damaged in Merrick County. Ten bridges were damaged in Merrick County as well. In York County, emergency rescues, one by helicopter and one by air boat, were made to retrieve stranded people trapped by flood waters southeast of Waco and near McCool Junction. Water was over Highway 81 north of Fairmont at the height of the event. In Fillmore and York counties, 5 to 8 inches of rain fell. Further west, a section of Highway 40 was washed out near Miller. Flood damage was in the tens of millions of dollars, with 12 to 15 million dollars in damage in Hall County alone. 
	
As flooding rains soaked the region, large hail, high winds and one tornado pounded the area. Hastings was particularly hard hit as baseball size hail and high winds belted the city for about 20 minutes. Literally, thousands of vehicles and homes sustained damage, especially on the east side of town, including downtown. Damage was estimated at 40 million, and that may be conservative and insurance agencies processed claims. State Farm Insurance was expecting to process 3,000 claims alone. Thirty-three people left their homes for shelter provided by the city. In Wood River, a tornado clipped the south side of town. In Merrick County, two Union Pacific trains derailed due to high winds and a tower for KMMJ radio was blown down north of town. A communications tower was also destroyed in Buffalo County by high winds. There were widespread, though brief, power outages in the area. At one point, about 60 percent of the city of Lexington was without power. Twelve center pivot irrigation systems were damaged in Fillmore County. High winds destroyed a barn southeast of Gothenburg and grain binds south of Darr in Dawson County. Officials estimate, 2800 homes and businesses had damaged in Grand Island.

There was above normal snowpack across the higher elevations of the Adirondacks with snow depths at least a foot above normal. A warm front lifted northward across the area on Tuesday, April 26th, ushering in a warm and humid airmass. Temperatures rose into the 70s and 80s across the area on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, April 27th (15 to 25 degrees above normal). In addition, overnight lows were mild. 

An area of heavy showers and embedded thunderstorms accompanied the warm front as it moved through on Tuesday, April 26th, impacting areas mainly north and west of the Capital District. The boundary became stationary near the Saint Lawrence River Valley and northern New England. A disturbance in the upper levels of the atmosphere and an area of low pressure moving towards the Great Lakes Region focused another round of showers and thunderstorms that impacted the western and central Mohawk Valley, Adirondack region, and the Upper Hudson River Valley including the Lake George Region late Wednesday afternoon into the early evening, April 27th. Yet another wave of low pressure moved into the eastern Great Lakes Region Thursday morning, April 28th. This low intensified as it approached and had strong upper level support favorable for strong to severe thunderstorms. Thunderstorms producing severe weather and very heavy rainfall moved over already saturated ground to the north and west of the Capital District during the morning hours. 

The combination of several rounds of heavy rainfall from convection, rapid snowmelt due to the warm temperatures and above normal soil moisture led to increased runoff and rapid river rises. Widespread flooding of rivers, streams and creeks occurred resulting in road closures and flooding of properties.

Lesser accumulations were reported elsewhere in southwest Minnesota in a band just to the northwest of this area. The snow fell from the afternoon of January 14th into the predawn hours of January 15th. Increasing northwest winds and falling temperatures caused dangerous wind chills near the end of the event. The winds also caused a few areas of blowing and drifting snow.",664066

				March 25-26, 2000 - Event Narrative

Thunderstorms the afternoon and evening of the 25th, and early morning hours of the 26th.

A cluster of severe storms developed over Young, Stephens, and Palo Pinto counties and moved east-southeast across north central Texas. A couple of long-lived supercells tracked from western Palo Pinto through southern Parker counties from 1500 CST to 1800 CST, and from northern Hood into Johnson and Ellis counties 1700 to 2000 CST. Other storms developed in the wake of this storm over Somervell county, and moved across southern Johnson, northern Hill, and western Navarro counties 2030C to 2230 CST.

Additional storms developed over Young, Jack, Palo Pinto, and Parker counties around 2300 CST, and followed similar paths through Hood, Johnson, southern Tarrant, northern Hill, Navarro, Freestone, and Anderson counties, into the early morning hours of the 26th.",408166

Overall, damage was dominated by numerous downed trees, large limbs, and power lines, though there were scattered occurrences of large hail with the more intense cells.  Localized small stream and poor drainage flooding was noted, but true flash flooding did not occur due to the rapid movement of the line.

Initial damage occurred across northwestern Virginia, where there were several instances of scattered trees and large limbs down across portions of Clarke, Loudoun, Warren, and Fauquier Cos.  There were several citizen and police reports of funnel clouds in the area, but surveys determined that damage was straight-line in nature - either due to embedded microbursts or the gust front.  Farther south, hail fell, most between three-quarters and one inch in diameter.  However, at least one cell produced more substantial hail across Greene, Orange, and Culpeper Cos.  In Elkwood (Culpeper Co), a wholesale greenhouse shop sustained considerable damage - broken glass and double-layered plastic - when hail, estimated at tennis-ball size, fell.  Medium-sized limbs and twigs were blown off trees at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

As the storms raced east, more tree and power line damage was noted, in Fairfax, Arlington, Stafford, and Spotsylvania Cos.  Damage appeared to be most significant in northern Spotsylvania Co.  In Fredericksburg, one tree fell onto a car and another onto a garage; the wind blew over several tents at a local arts festival, damaging most of one vendor's work and about $1,000 worth of pottery at another stand.  Elsewhere in the county, a tree fell on a house and another fell onto a mobile home, each causing some damage.  At least a half dozen large trees were reported down in Falls Church; several others were knocked down in Alexandria.

The combination of wind damage and lightning knocked power out to at least 56,000 Virginia Power customers in northern Virginia; several thousand other residents served by Allegheny Power and local electric co-operatives likely lost power in western Virginia as well.  One notable lightning strike occurred on the James River just south of Scottsville (Albemarle Co); two youths were shocked while swimming to shore after ""tubing"".  Each sustained only minor injuries, and were treated and released from the University of Virginia medical center.

Strong southerly pre-frontal wind gusts of around 60 mph were common ahead of the storm.  Blizzard conditions were reported from Buffalo south to Casper as strong northeast upslope flow developed as the storm progressed east.  Frequent reports of sustained wind of 35 mph with gusts to around 50 mph were received.  The peak wind gust at Buffalo, one of the hardest hit areas, was 64 mph.
Impressive snowfall was received in conjunction with the prolonged period of upslope flow.  Snowfall amounts of three to five feet were common in the Bighorn and Wind River Mountains, and on Casper Mountain.  The peak snow total was estimated to be six feet at the Hobbs Park SNOTEL in the Wind River Mountains.  Most lower elevation locations reported snowfall of 8 to 20 inches.  However, the favored upslope location of Lander received around 30 inches of snow.
The combination of the wind and snow caused many roads to be closed.  By Thursday morning most routes out of Casper and Buffalo were closed with drifts of several feet being reported in some locations.  A multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 90 north of Buffalo closed that road early Wednesday.  The crash involved a bus carrying 39 students, seven semi-tractor trailers, and 11 other vehicles.

The rubber membrane roof of the War Memorial Building in Winchester was punctured by hail the size of golf balls, allowing heavy rain to fall inside the structure and cause significant water damage.   Numerous cars were damaged by hail, averaging $1300 in repairs.  Winchester city police reported damage to 15 cruisers, and automobile dealers on Valley Avenue reported damage to over 150 cars.  Hundreds of other privately owned vehicles received dents and broken windshields.  Property owners also reported damage to roofs, siding, windows, and landscaping from the 10 minute deluge.

Summary of events for May 24-25 1998:

Many severe thunderstorms affected northern Oklahoma during the evening of May 24 and the early morning of May 25.  On the evening of May 24, the first thunderstorms moved south of the Kansas state line after 900 PM CDT.  After that, individual thunderstorms kept moving along a quasi-stationary front near the Oklahoma/Kansas border, causing one thunderstorm after another to move over the same areas just south of the Kansas state line.  One result was widespread rainfall amounts in excess of one inch with a storm total of 3.68 inches reported 8 ESE of Foraker and several unoffical reports of about 4 inches.  These storms were also prolific wind producers with thunderstorm gusts of 60 to 70 miles an hour common across the northern border counties.  Additionally, there were reports of a tornado touchdown north of Pawhuska and hail as large as quarters.  After 1100 PM CDT, the last in the series of storms took a more southward route across Rogers, Mayes, and Delaware Counties, producing severe winds and hail as large as golfballs, before exiting into Benton County AR around 300 AM CDT.  

Around 200 AM CDT, more severe thunderstorms developed in northwest Oklahoma and moved east along an outflow boundary produced by the earlier thunderstorms.  These storms moved across Pawnee and Tulsa Counties between 430 AM and 630 AM CDT, producing marginally severe hail and winds.  These storms weakened below severe levels as they moved past Tulsa County.

Strong southerly flow ahead of this storm system brought ample Gulf of Mexico moisture all the way into southern Canada, setting the stage for significant precipitation accumulations across the region. Winter storm and blizzard watches and warnings were posted well in advance of the storm. Warning lead time averaged nearly 25 hours. 

Precipitation started in the form of rain and thunderstorms Sunday into Monday morning, before changing over to all snow west to east Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning.  Additionally, strong northwest winds of 20 to 45 mph accompanying the snow, produced widespread blizzard conditions west during the day on Monday, then across central North Dakota Monday evening and into Tuesday morning. Further east, around the James River Basin area, winter storm warnings were in effect due to a wintry mix of rain, snow, and sleet and for lighter snow accumulations. 

Blizzard conditions continued across much of southwestern and central North Dakota on Tuesday, with conditions then gradually improving Tuesday night as the snow ended and the winds subsided. Storm total snow amounts ranged from 12 to 22.5 inches across southwest North Dakota, to five to 11 inches central. No travel advisories, road closures, power outages, and school and business closures were common during this significant spring storm.EVENT NARRATIVE: ",751816

The initial rounds of significant severe storms targeted the area during a 7-hour stretch centered from 9 PM CDT Sunday evening to 4 AM CDT Monday morning. During this nocturnal event, multiple severe supercell and multicell storms pounded mainly the northwest half of South Central Nebraska, or locations northwest of a line from Beaver City to Grand Island to Osceola. Generally speaking, severe weather during this 7-hour period came in three separate rounds, although there was some overlap in both time and area. Despite a favorable environment for tornadic development, no tornadoes were confirmed during this event. 

The first round of severe weather, centered between 9 PM and 11 PM CDT, involved one large, intense supercell storm that drifted east out of southwest Nebraska, primarily impacting Furnas, Gosper, Harlan and Phelps Counties. This storm resulted in several reports of destructive hail up to tennis ball size, and winds of at least 60-70 MPH. One of the hardest hit areas was northern Furnas County in and around Cambridge and Arapahoe, where damage reports included the displacement of a 5-ton air handling unit atop the hospital in Cambridge, and a stock trailer thrown into a corn field.

As the initial supercell started to gradually weaken, a new area of vigorous severe storm development took place north of Interstate 80, expanding in coverage between 11 PM and 2 AM CDT. The most intense storm during this time frame tracked nearly due east from Sherman County to northern Polk County, with reports along the way including hail to the size of tennis balls and baseballs. Some of the worst known wind damage occurred in Merrick County, where estimated winds to 80 MPH destroyed an old grain elevator between Clarks and Silver Creek.

A strong low pressure system (Nor'easter) moved north to northeast, passing just east of Montauk Point before Midnight on January 25th.

Snow developed between 4 and 5 am along the immediate coast and spread rapidly north during the morning rush hour.  Snowfall rates up to 2 inches per hour occurred during the peak of the morning rush hour.  White-out conditions caused massive traffic interruptions.  Snowfall during the morning commute ranged from around 2 inches at Elizabeth in Union County to around 6 inches at Teterboro Airport in Bergen County.  As warm air in the lower levels wrapped around this storm, snow changed to freezing rain and sleet, which continued from mid-morning through late afternoon.  As the low approached Long Island during the evening, bands of moderate to heavy snow rotated northwest around the low.

Here are selected snowfall amounts from this storm for:

Passaic County:  from 6.5 inches at Clifton to 8 inches at West Milford.

Bergen County:  from 6 inches at Rutherford, Teterboro, Hasbrouck Heights, and Fairlawn to 6.5 inches at Lyndhurst.

Essex County:  from 5.5 inches at Newark Airport to 6.1 inches at Nutley.

Hudson County:  from 4.5 inches at Jersey City to 6 inches at Secaucus.

Union County:  6.2 inches was measured at Elizabeth.

This low was preceded by strong northeast winds that gusted from 40 to 45 mph.

Afternoon temperatures warmed into the upper 80s to mid 90s, with dewpoint readings in the upper 70s to low 80s.  A weak boundary extended out of eastern Nebraska across northern Iowa.  This boundary helped to focus moisture.  At the same time, a negatively tilted shortwave lifted northeast out of the Rockies into Nebraska during the afternoon and early evening.  The lifted index fell to -10 to -14 C by evening with CAPE rising to 5000-7000 J/kg in the very moist airmass.  The freezing level was very high, between 16,000 and 17,000 feet.  As a result, there was little in the way of hail.  The downdraft CAPE was quite high, 800 to 1400 J/kg.  Thunderstorms formed in northeast Nebraska.  They rapidly formed into an upscale MCS, and eventually a full-fledged MCC.  Precipitable water values were extremely high, in the 2.5 to 2.75 inch range.  The primary mode of severe weather with the system was in the form of high wind.  Wind gusts of 60 to 70 MPH caused sporadic damage across western into central Iowa with tree damage, as well as damage to outbuildings.  The storms produced one funnel cloud in Carroll County.  The high precipitable water values led to very heavy rainfall with widespread flash flooding.  A swath of 2 to 5 inch rainfall extended from west central, through central, into parts of southeast Iowa.  There were numerous reports of a foot or more of flowing water over streets.  Following the flash flooding, water remained standing on many roads due to the soils across the state being nearly saturated.  This resulted in some road closures.  The Des Moines metropolitan area was hard hit as 3 to 5 inches of rain fell in 4 hours or less.  This caused extensive flooding in the city.  Some evacuations took place.  One was at a trailer court along Four Mile Creek on the east side of Des Moines.  Numerous roads were closed on the west side as well as Walnut Creek jumped its banks.

Typhoon Ivan (27W) formed on the 9th about 300 miles east of Majuro in the Marshall Islands. It remained 
weak for a few days as it passed through the Marshalls and casued no damage. It became a tropical storm
on the 13th. It continued moving west and passed south of Guam early on the morning of the 15th. On the 15th a peak wind of 47 mph was observed at Anderson Air Force Base on northern Guam and 29 mph  observed at the National Weather Service Office in Tiyan. On the 15th 5.26 inches of rain fell at Anderson Air Force Base and 3 inches at the Tiyan Weather Service Office as a spiral band from the tropical storm passed across the island. This caused Urban and Small Stream flooding in some areas. Tropical Storm Ivan became a typhoon during the late afternoon of the 15th, but was already moving away from the Marianas Islands. The typhoon remained in the Guam Area of Operations until the 17th.

Super Typhoon Joan (28W) formed on the 11th to the east of Majuro. It became a tropical storm onthe 14th and reached typhoon strength on the 15th. The typhoon continued to intensify as it moved west-norhwest. It passed about 50 miles north of Saipan and 30 miles south of Anatahan on the 18th. Saipan was slow to respond to the threat of the typhoon, as a result, people were still making storm preperations when the high winds began. Three people were injured when they were boarding up their house. The injuries were caused in part by flying boards. By hte morning of the 19th the entire inland of Saipan had lost power. A few houses had tin roofs damaged. At least 37 houses were destroyed. Anatahan did not fare as well. Damage was extensive across the island. Machinery, boats and public property sustained damage. Crops such as banana, cassava and taro were also damaged. All of the damage on Anatahan amounted to at least $200,000.

A band of moisture flowing into Typhoon Joan moved across Guam on the 19th. This resulted in 1.99 inches 
of rain falling at the Tiyan Weather Office and 2.20 inches at Anderson Air Force Base. This band also caused winds to gust to 41 mph at the Tiyan Weather Office.

What was to become Super Typhoon Keith (29W) was spotted as a tropical disturbance east of Majuro in the Marshall Islands on the 22nd. It became a tropical storm on the 28th southwest of Jaluit. On the afternoon of the 30th Keith became a typhoon. On the 30th the typhoon passed 90 miles norht of Mokil,
130 miles south of Ujelang and 125 miles norht of Pingelap. During the early morning hours of the 31st the
typhoon passed 115 miles north of Pohnpei. Some brief periods of winds of 25 to 35 mph with gust to 50 mph were reported across these islands. No reports of damage or injury were reported from these islands.

This is the first time a winter storm of this magnitude has ever occurred in October.

Late Friday night, October 28, an area of low pressure emerged from the South Carolina coastal plain into the western Atlantic Ocean.  The low moved up the coast late Friday night into Saturday morning.  The low began to rapidly strengthen late Saturday morning when it was east of the Delmarva coast, and continued to strengthen as it passed south of Long Island Saturday night.  With water temperatures in the lower 60s, extreme southeast coastal Connecticut received mainly rainfall and up to 3 inches of rain during the event.  Areas just to the north and west, however, were just cold enough to support a heavy wet snow.  The heaviest snow fell along a corridor through interior southwest Connecticut, with up to a foot of snow in the highest elevations.  In addition to the heavy rain and snow, strong winds were experienced along the immediate coastline. 

Hundreds of thousands of people across southern Connecticut lost power during this event as heavy snow accumulated on trees that still had partial to full foliage during mid-autumn.  This caused extensive felling of trees and limbs across the region and damage to power lines.EVENT NARRATIVE: ",900417

Forty tornadoes, 30 of which touched down in Central Alabama, occurred in the state. At the time, this set a new record for number of tornadoes within the state from one event. This record was broken on April 27, 2011. 

A surface low developed across the Central Plains on Thursday, April 14, and strengthened as it moved into the mid-Mississippi River Valley.  In response, surface dew points in the middle to upper 60s surged northward into Central Alabama and deep vertical wind shear increased, providing support for tornadic supercell development. A weakening line of thunderstorms moved into northwest Central Alabama early Friday morning. The southern end of this line intensified by mid day as it encountered a more unstable airmass. South of the line, supercells formed in Mississippi and tracked eastward into west Central Alabama. The entire system pushed east across the area over the course of about twelve hours, exiting east Central Alabama in the early morning hours on Saturday, April 16. In addition to the thirty tornadoes, the storm system produced widespread straight line wind damage and numerous large hail reports.EVENT NARRATIVE: A tornado touched down 1.5 miles northeast of Boone's Chapel in the Hunting Area community.

A slow moving and enormous storm over North America brought record single-storm snowfall to much of North Dakota.  Over two feet of snow fell over a large part of central and southeast North Dakota, and most of North Dakota had over a foot of snow from this storm. 
The greatest snowfall amount was reported at Oakes, in Dickey county in southeast North Dakota, 31 inches.  At the National Weather Service office in Bismarck, 28.3 inches of snow was measured during the 108-hour snow event.  This amount set a new single-storm record for snow
in Bismarck.  The snow began the evening of the 22nd and did not end until the morning of the 27th.  Except for about six hours during the day on the 26th, the snow was continuous through this period. 
The snowfall was intermittent over most of North Dakota during this lengthy event.  Fortunately, the wind was only 10 to 25 MPH during this storm, so it was well below blizzard conditions and blowing and drifting of snow was not a problem. 
The storm occurred during the week of Thanksgiving, so many travelers were stranded.  The prolonged snowfall kept snow removal crews working around the clock, and a few motorists crashed into the snowplows.  Out in the rural areas, some farm buildings collapsed in the heavy snow. ",221698

Tree damage was widespread with the most concentrated from the Red Lick and Lorman areas to Fayette to the southwest portion of the county. In Fayette, 2 mobile homes were destroyed by fallen trees and 1 other sustained minor damage. Several roads were blocked by fallen trees as well. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A rare and widespread significant wind event impacted the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area during the evening of Aug 2nd and lasted into the early morning hours of Aug 3rd. Several clusters of storms developed across Northern Mississippi and Northern Alabama during the late afternoon and became further organized as the clusters moved to the south and southwest. Between 8 and 9 pm, a bowing line of storms was located from Oxford to Starkville, growing larger by the minute, and picking up speed as wind gusts between 50 and 70 mph were taking shape.

A large bow echo quickly evolved and raced to the west-southwest, across Mississippi, through the evening at 50 to 60 mph. The line of storms produced widespread severe wind gusts around 60 mph with many locations seeing significant wind gusts between 75 and 80 mph. Tree and power line damage was widespread and significant along the line with the focus and most intense portion of the bow echo located within an axis from Louisville, MS to Jackson, MS to St. Joseph, LA.

Some of the most significant wind damage occurred across Winston, Neshoba, Leake and Scott counties. Here, thousands of trees were downed along with numerous power lines. Many roads were blocked by downed trees, especially across Scott County. Wind gusts across these areas likely peaked between 75 and 85 mph.

The bow echo was re-energized across Madison and Hinds Counties as the line clashed with pre-line storms. The most intense portion of the bow echo was re-focused as it impacted portions of southern Madison and Hinds County. The most intense portion of the line then dove southwest and impacted Copiah, Claiborne, Jefferson, Franklin and Adams Counties. As the line crossed the Mississippi River, the parishes of Tensas and Concordia saw the brunt of the damaging winds. Similar to areas across Central Mississippi, these locations received significant winds between 75 and 85 mph. Thousands of trees and numerous power lines were downed from the winds. Power outages were substantial as many locations were without power for 2 to 4 days.

Looking at this event in a historic perspective, it was likely the most significant and widespread wind event ever in August for our forecast area.",716802

Freezing rain in western Massachusetts caused severe icing of roadways, especially in the valleys of Franklin, Hampshire, and Hampden Counties.  Many towns reported states of emergency.  Roads were closed in many communities, including Goshen, Northfield, Colrain, Florida, Heath, Cummington, Chester, Gill, Huntington, and Russell.  Thunderstorms accompanied the freezing rain during the afternoon.

Strong south winds occurred ahead of an approaching cold front, mainly in the eastern part of the state, but also across the higher elevations of western and central Massachusetts.  Gusts as high as 45 to 55 mph were common.  A spotter in Tyngsboro reported a peak gust to 63 mph at 920 pm, which occurred just behind the cold front.  A gust to 59 mph was reported from West Island on Buzzard's Bay.  Other strong wind gusts included 58 mph in Taunton (spotter), 54 mph at the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton, 53 mph in Worcester, 47 mph at Logan International Airport in Boston, and 46 mph in Hyannis.  In Dartmouth, in Bristol County, wires were downed by the strong winds.  There were many reports of downed branches, some of which caused power outages by falling on wires.

Scattered thunderstorms were reported throughout most of  the state, however the strong winds were not directly associated with the thunderstorms.  The exception was on Martha's Vineyard, where thunderstorms produced a wind gust to 60 mph at the Martha's Vineyard Airport around 900 pm.  In Oak Bluffs on the Vineyard, large tree limbs were downed and a small shed was blown down at the high school.  Lightning strikes resulted in several power outages, and in central Massachusetts, lightning started an attic fire in Gardner, causing minor damage to a building.  ",359805

It slowly moved eastnortheast and by Sunday morning the 30th was located near Apalachicola Florida, not too far from the location of the January 25th storm. Unlike the previous storm, this one tracked farther to the west and moved northeast along the Atlantic Seaboard. By the morning of the 31st, it was located near Boston, Massachusetts. There was less cold air present at the start of the storm, especially along the coastal plain.  Most of it was in the lowest layers of the atmosphere. This led to the more typical potpourri of weather across New Jersey with primarily rain in the southeast part of the state and heavy snow in the northwest part of the state.

Precipitation started during the afternoon as snow throughout most of the state. Along the coast and in the southeast part of the state enough warm air was already present for precipitation to just briefly start as either sleet or rain before changing to rain. By early evening precipitation had changed to sleet and freezing rain across the southwest part of the state, but still falling as snow in the west central and northwest part of the state.  By 9 p.m. EST enough warm air had moved into the southwest part of the state to change the precipitation to plain rain. Meanwhile at that time a transition to sleet and freezing rain was occurring in the west central and northwest part of the state. The cold air was deep enough in Sussex County for precipitation to continue to fall as mainly snow.  By 10 p.m. EST sleet had made it as far north as Warren County.  Precipitation ended from south to north from midnight through 3 a.m. EST on the 31st.  Temperatures never made it above freezing in the northwest part of the state.  Accumulations were highest in the northwest part of the state where precipitation fell as snow the longest. The greatest accretion of ice, around one-quarter of an inch, occurred in townships along the Delaware River from Salem County to Mercer County. The ice brought down a couple of power lines and caused isolated outages. Untreated roadways were very treacherous and high traffic volume due to Super Bowl Sunday exacerbated the problems. 

Snowfall accumulations of an inch or more included: in Sussex County  8.5 inches in Stillwater, 7.5 inches in High Point, 7 inches in Highland Lakes, 6.5 inches in Wantage and 6 inches in Sparta; in Warren County 8 inches in Belvidere and 7 inches in Blairstown; in Morris County 5.5 inches in Marcella, 5 inches in Long Valley and 4.5 inches in Morristown; in Hunterdon County 6 inches in Reigelsville, 5 inches in Bloomsbury and 4 inches in White House Station; in Somerset County 2 inches in Somerville, in Middlesex County, 1.8 inches in New Brunswick and in Mercer County 1.5 inches in Hamilton Square.

As the thunderstorm complex reached the Mohawk Valley, it evolved into a supercell. The supercell then developed into a mesoscale convective system (MCS) as it move into the Lake George / Saratoga region and into the northern Taconics.  This storm left a large swath of damage including numerous trees and power poles knocked down in the Herkimer County towns of Russia, Ohio, Norway, Fairfield, Salisbury and Dolgeville.  A National Weather Service team was deployed to investigate the damage in Poland and Newport also in Herkimer County.  
	In Poland, the team found  a swath of snapped trees and six snapped power poles on Route 8 between North Gage and Brayton Roads, knocked down in the same direction in a path two tenths of a mile wide. The winds were estimated to have blown as high as 60 to 80 mph.  Similar damage was reported in the area where Route 28 crosses the West Canada Creek.  At the intersection of Route 28 and Main Street, two large pine trees were knocked down onto a house and car.  Eyewitnesses also reported hail as large as two inches in diameter.  Along Route 28 just south of Newport, large trees and power poles were knocked down by straight line winds again estimated between 60 and 80 mph. On Main street in Newport, more trees and power lines were downed, all in the same direction and one tree fell onto a house. Eyewitnesses also reported one and a half inch hail diameter.  In Fairfield, near the intersection of Route 29 and Platform Road, a tree toppled onto a car but  did not injure the driver. A trailer home was totally destroyed near that town as well. 
	Police reported numerous trees and wires down between 6 and 7 PM throughout a large area of Fulton County.  The National Weather Service investigated an area around Stratford which had the most concentrated damage in the county.  They found a large scattering of downed trees and power lines in the vicinity of Route 29A, between Paper Mill Corners and Stratford Road. There were reports of a rotating wall cloud in this vicinity.
	Wind damage then spread into Warren County, as power lines were blown down in both the villages of Lake Luzerne and Lake George. A 75 mph wind gust was observed in Stillwater, Saratoga County with trees also blown down. Also in Saratoga County,  scattered trees were blown down in Malta, Clifton Park, Saratoga Springs and Saratoga Lake. At one point, 30 roads were temporarily closed throughout Saratoga Springs. At  Saratoga Lake, a huge tree fell onto and crushed three boats.  
	 Even though the core of the storm passed north of Schenectady, winds from the outflow boundary were strong enough to produce wind damage in the city of Schenectady. Police reported numerous trees and wires down as well as siding ripped off a building. There was one damage report in Rensselaer County.  Trees and wires were blown down at Melrose.
	The National Weather Service Team concluded that the damage from this cluster of storms was the result of straight line thunderstorm winds.  The thunderstorms temporarily knocked out  power to an estimated 10,000 customers in the Lake George Saratoga Region and an additional 3,000 homes in the Mohawk Valley.",435726

This storm produced a large amount of baseball sized hail and even some stones up to the size of softballs between Solomon and Abilene.  Some of the storms had strong rotation and one storm produced a funnel cloud near Agenda. Aside from the significant hail and brief funnels, these storms were slow moving and brought torrential rain which has caused significant flooding to Manhattan, Louisville, Ogden, and Morganville.

Duration-wise, this was one of the most prolific severe weather events of the 2011 season, with convective warnings in effect for parts of the area for over 9 straight hours from around 4 PM to 130 AM CDT. Storm report highlights included numerous instances of large hail from quarter to baseball size, an estimated wind gust to 80 MPH, and a brief EF0 tornado west of Lexington. Many areas also measured 1-2 inches of rain in a short time, with one storm sending a few inches of water running through an Elm Creek grocery store.

This event essentially consisted of multiple, splitting supercell storms developing and tracking over the same areas.  The first supercells developed just west and southwest of the area around 4 PM CDT and soon pushed into Dawson and Furnas Counties. These and other storms pounded the area for a few hours into the early evening, featuring the brief tornado near Lexington, and baseball size hail near Cozad. Following a brief lull in areal coverage of severe storms, considerable redevelopment took place between 8 PM and 10 PM CDT, with these storms also remaining severe as they evolved over the next few hours. Although most activity weakened or moved out of the area by midnight, one last supercell dropped golf ball size hail in northern Buffalo County shortly before 1 AM CDT. 

Although the mesoscale environment was supportive of severe weather, the long-lasting nature of this event was somewhat unexpected given a lack of large-scale forcing. The mid-levels featured only subtle, weak shortwave energy, well downstream from a powerful trough centered along the Pacific Northwest coast. However, deep-layer vertical wind sheaEVENT NARRATIVE: ",881029

A powerful winter storm pumped abundant moisture on very strong southerly winds into western North Carolina. The result was nearly 15 million dollars in damage across the mountains and foothills as up to 15 inches of rain fell on the higher terrain, causing significant to major flooding and flash flooding.  The Asheville Airport  set a new record for 24 hour rainfall in the month of January with 4.42 inches. Where not specified above, the excessive rain caused creeks and streams to rise well out of their banks. This combined with the enormous amounts of run-off to cause numerous roads and bridges to be covered in water or washed out. The Blue Ridge Parkway in Haywood county sustained considerable damage. 

A few counties experienced widespread flooding for several hours before convective rain pushed north across the mountains, overwhelming already saturated ground and raging water basins. People in Avery , Mitchell and Yancey counties reported ""a wall of water"" that ripped through several communities. Rock and/or mudslides also occurred in Swain and Transylvania counties, adding to the work of clean-up crews. 

In addition, high gradient winds of at least 55 mph blew numerous trees and power lines down.  Especially hard hit was Transylvania county where hundreds of trees fell, some on homes, and power was out for much of the population until well into the the next day.

High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.

A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.

Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.

The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.

A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.

The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.

As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 
tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.

Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.

Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.

Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.

Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.

Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.

Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.

Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.

Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.

Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.

Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.  This tornado was ANTICYCLONIC in nature.",573838

Was caused by the overflow from the Middle River. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A very dynamic weather situation unfolded during the 5th into the 6th.  Although the atmosphere was summer like in the lower elevations, the upper levels were more typical of April.  A strong upper level low pressure area lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies with a negatively tilted trough of low pressure lifting northeast across the central U.S.  An intense low pressure area developed over northern Kansas and lifted north into southeast North Dakota by the morning of the 6th, with a central Pressure of 984 mb.  During the day on the 5th, the atmosphere was capped with the freezing level rising to 15,600 feet by the evening hours over central Iowa.  A warm front lifted north across Iowa, with temperatures warming into the mid 80s to the south of the front with dewpoint readings in the low 70s.  It became quite unstable by evening with MUCAPE between 2500 and 3000 J/kg and lifted indices in the -5 to -9 C. range.  Considerable shear was available with the effective shear between 40 and 65 kts by evening.  Downdraft CAPE was between 800 and 1400 J/kg across the CWA, with 400 to 500 J/kg of CAPE available in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere.  The airmass became very moist by evening with 1.6 to 1.9 inches of precipitable water available by evening.  The LCL fall to between 750 and 1250 meters.  Thunderstorms erupted to the southwest of Iowa in central Kansas, along the dry line there.  The storms raced northeast into Iowa by sunset.  In spite of the dynamics that were in place, the amount of severe weather was relatively limited.  Hail was limited by the high freezing level and lack of supercellular development.  Several of the storms produced small hail and a few produced high winds.  There were several reports of brief tornado touchdowns, but little in the way of damage was reported for the most part.  The first tornado touched down in Cass County and was only on the ground briefly.  Another tornado touched down in Union County.  The tornado took the roof off of an outbuilding and knocked down some power lines.  The strongest tornado was on the ground for over 18 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The tornado track was over open country for the most part and damaged outbuildings and one house.  Three other tornadoes touched down in Jasper County, causing some moderate damage.  The most significant feature with this event was the flash flooding.  Soil conditions across the state were very saturated.  Any significant rainfall resulted in flash flooding.  A narrow band of heavier rainfall stretched from south central into central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in the Des Moines metro area as the airport recorded 4.15 inches of rainfall for the day, with about 3 inches falling in two hours.  Reports of severe street flooding were received with numerous reports of manhole covers being blown off.  During the event, high winds occurred over the far northwest part of the CWA as the surface low intensified rapidly and the gradient tightened.  A window was blown out in Pocahontas County, with tree and power line damage done in Emmet County.  A barn was also damaged near Gruver in Emmet County by the high wind.",703964

A warm front moving north through the area resulted in favorable vertical wind shear to allow for supercell development.

The 1st round of severe weather was due to a broken line of intense thunderstorms moving  across Walworth, Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha counties.  Hail of up to 1 inch in diameter and torrential rainfall accompanied these storms before they moved over Lake Michigan and weakened.  The 2nd round of severe weather was dominated by 2 cyclic supercells - one moved east/southeast through Marquette, Green Lake, Fond du Lac, and Washington Counties, spinning up 5 separate tornadoes, dumping hail stones up to 3 inches in diameter, and hurricane-force downburst winds.  The large hail dented several vehicles.  Two of these were rated F3.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.  A more southerly supercell tracked across extreme southern Sauk County and then made a partial right turn and headed southeast through Dane County, spinning up 2 tornadoes in the process, as well as large hail and downburst winds.  One powerful downburst wind in Madison (Dane Co.) blew equipment off the roof of a business at the Midvale Shopping Mall.  A semi southwest of Ft. Atkinson was blown over by straight-line wind gusts.  This southern supercell eventually spun up another tornado in south-central Jefferson County which moved into north-central Walworth County.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.

Both supercells had downbursts that generated large hail and powerful, hurricane-force winds north and south of their tracks.  Over all of Wisconsin, 16 tornadoes were documented on June 23rd, which is the 4th highest single-day total (record is 24 on May 8, 1988).

Most of the storms were multi-cellular in nature, including multiple but relatively small severe storms that tracked across the Omaha metro over a period of 1 to 2 hours.  However, a few storms developed supercell characteristics including one that produced a funnel cloud saw by many, and large hail near Surprise.

The month began with continued major flooding along the Mississippi River generally from Burlington northward, and moderate flooding south of Burlington.  Continued rain, heavy at times, kept the river above flood stage for most of May.  In fact heavy rains helped lead to a second crest on the Mississippi River.  This second crest was higher than the first crest, from Keithsburg southward.  Persistent heavy rains, especially over Southeast Iowa, Northeast Missouri and West Central Illinois, led to flooding on Mississippi River tributaries, which in turn led to a third crest on the Mississippi River, along with prolonged flooding.  The third crest was higher than the second crest, from Burlington southward.  Once the Mississippi River began falling, it fell rapidly at times.  During the falling limb, Mississippi River stage changes over 24 hour periods were as much as around 1 foot or more.

Scattered thunderstorms formed to the west of Iowa initially in a scattered line.  They coalesced into a small forward propagating MCS by the evening hours.  The airmass was moderately sheared with 40 to 45 kts of effective shear.  The freezing level was quite high, around 14,500 feet, so hail was limited.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 700 and 1100 J/kg.  The storms produced high winds as the primary mode of severe weather.  This was not too surprising considering there was 1500 J/kg of downdraft CAPE available just ahead of the MCS.  Initially the storms did produce hail as the cells were more discrete.  Dime to quarter size hail was reported in Crawford and Audubon Counties.  The system quickly became a wind event as it raced across the southern third to half of Iowa.  Winds speeds of 60 to 70 MPH were common along its path.  The highest measured wind gust was 71 MPH northwest of Creston.

Surface based CAPE just south of the front was in the 1500 to 2000 J/kg range.  A southwest low level jet of 30 to 40 knots pushed across the front.  The main mode of severe weather was in the form of hail as the freezing level was only 9300 MSL.  Thunderstorms erupted to the north of the warm front along the 850 mb warm front.  The storms became severe and most produced hail and heavy rain.  Hail of nickel to golf ball size was quite common.   The largest hail occurred in central Iowa with golf ball size hail reported in Polk, Madison, and Warren Counties.  Quarter size hail completely covered the ground south of Indianola in Warren County.",613751

The resulting glaze on untreated roadways led to numerous accidents. Precipitation was spottier across south central New Jersey, but was steadier north of Interstate 195 which just about divides the state in half. Ice accretions in the southern part of the state were less than one-tenth of an inch while ice accretions across the northern part of the state averaged between one-tenth and two-tenths of an inch. In the southern part of the state, precipitation briefly started as sleet a little after Midnight EST before changing to freezing rain. In the northern part of the state, precipitation started as sleet between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. EST and changed over to freezing rain in all areas by 4 a.m. EST. Temperatures continued to rise that morning and by 7 a.m. EST, the freezing rain changed to plain rain in the southern part of the state. Between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. EST precipitation changed to plain rain in the northern part of the state.

The recent unseasonably cold weather made it easier for slippery conditions to develop on untreated roadways and led to a rash of accidents. In Morris County, Interstate 287 was closed during the morning because of accidents. Accidents occurred on Interstate 80 in Mount Olive Township. Numerous crashes also were reported on Interstate 80 in Warren County and on Interstate 78 in Warren Township and Interstate 287 in Bernards Township (both in Somerset County).

In Monmouth County, in Manalapan Township, six accidents were reported. In Ocean County, in Lakewood, multiple accidents were reported. One motorist was injured after striking a pole. In a separate incident, a woman carrying an infant slipped and fell injuring herself. The number of accidents slowed after sunrise.

The freezing rain and sleet was caused by a low pressure system and its approaching warm front. Precipitation developed preceding the warm front. The arctic high pressure system over the region left enough cold air near the surface for precipitation to start as sleet and freezing rain.",723313

Bow echo signatures appeared along the line in eastcentral Oklahoma.  Rotation was indicated at the north end of the bow echo as it moved from near Eufaula to the Arkansas state line at West Siloam Springs.

Light snow develop across the mountains during the late evening hours on the 5th and early morning hours on the 6th. By the late morning hours, snowfall amounts generally ranged from 1 to 3 inches. The snow became heavy across southwest Virginia during the late morning hours on the 6th and spread north and east across the remainder of southwest, west-central and south-central Virginia. Sleet mixed with the snow at times across Charlotte, Halifax, and southern Pittsylvania Counties. Significant accumulations of snow continued in many areas until the afternoon hours on the 7th. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour were common, mainly along and west of the Blue Ridge. Snow depths by the evening hours on the 7th ranged from near 12 inches in Danville and South Boston in south-central Virginia and in Richlands in southwest Virginia to around 30 inches in northern portions of Rockbridge County. Average snow depths greater than 24 inches were recorded in Bath, Rockbridge, Alleghany, Botetourt, Amherst, Craig, Montgomery, and Giles Counties. A record 24 hour snowfall amount of 22.2 inches was established at the Roanoke Regional Airport. A record 24 hour snowfall amount of 20.0 inches was established at the Lynchburg Regional Airport. Total snowfall amounts included 36.5 inches in Burkes Garden, 35 inches at Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, and 34 inches in Blacksburg. The snow combined with winds of 15 to 30 mph with higher gusts on the 7th and 8th resulted in snow drifts up to 10 feet high. A state of emergency was declared for all of southwest, west-central and south-central Virginia.

In Carroll County, an 80 year old man from Woodlawn died from hypothermia after he fell into a snow drift. A traffic accident cost the life of a Rockbridge County man. Another accident in Montgomery County resulted in the death of a truck driver.

The weight of the snow collapsed the roof of a large building in Christiansburg and a green house in Amherst. Damage to the greenhouse and the plants inside was estimated at $20,000. Damage to the building in Christiansburg was $600,000. The weight of the snow collapsed a carport on top of a Corvette in Charlotte County. In addition, awnings collapsed in Henry and Alleghany Counties.

Many areas hired contract personnel to aid in plowing roads. In the mountains, many secondary county roads remained unplowed for several days. During and shortly after the storm, some snow plows assisted emergency vehicles in reaching their destinations. The National Guard used several humvees and a few armored personnel carriers to transport medical and emergency personnel to work or to those in need. The mail was not delivered for several days in many areas. Stranded motorists filled up many motels along interstates. In the mountains on the 7th, travel in anything other than a 4-wheel drive vehicle was nearly impossible. The snow was so deep in this area than even some 4-wheel drive vehicles got stuck. As a result of hazardous conditions from the late morning hours on the 6th to the late afternoon hours on the 11th, there were numerous traffic accidents and several injuries. Several snow plows slid off of roads and overturned. The cost of snow removal, including overtime, salt, sand, equipment repairs, and contract personnel generally ranged from $100,000 to $400,000 per county.

Numerous storm shelters were established across the area. Prior to the storm and after the storm, many grocery stores sold out of perishable items like break, milk, and eggs. There were several heroic life saving efforts to get medical attention, medicine or food to those stranded. There were only a few minor power outages reported. ",278337

Meanwhile a warm front was lifting north from the southern Plains.  The warm front separated the cooler and dry air to the north from very humid air to the south.  Dew point temperatures in the air to the south of the front were in the mid 70s to low 80s.  Precipitable water values were near 2 inches as well.  A meso scale convective system formed over north central Nebraska and south central South Dakota during the previous night.  The remains of this system drifted into west central Iowa during the predawn hours.  One cell became severe during the morning.  This was to be the pattern for much of the rest of the day as the cells that formed became super cellular, with each supercell lasting about 2 hours.  By the early afternoon hours, surface based CAPE values were approaching 6000 J/kg just to the south of the thunderstorm genesis region.  Once the storms formed they became supercells quickly.  Very strong sheer was in place with strong southeast surface winds veering to westerly winds in the mid levels.  Even though freezing levels were in excess of 15,000 feet, the storms were prolific hail producers.  WSR-88D VIL values with many of the supercells exceeded 90 kg/m/m.  There was also some high winds with the storms at times as many of the cells were rotating as was seen with WSR-88D imagery.  The first high winds occurred early in the severe event as 64 MPH winds blasted into the Dow City area of Crawford County.  Winds of 66 MPH were recorded at the Denison Municipal Airport as the storm moved through.  Damage was reported in many areas of the county.  During the day there were also other spotty reports of wind damage, however most of the were were in the 40 to 50 MPH range.  A few other cells did produce severe criteria winds as they moved into the central and northeast counties of the state with wind damage reported in Hardin, Hamilton, and Boone Counties.  These storms developed during the period of time the weather system was changing from a supercell type system into more of a multi-cell system.  The main severe weather event of the day was the hail.  Hail reports of one inch up to golf ball size were too numerous to mention.  Some of the hail was larger than tennis balls.  Baseball size hail fell in Guthrie County, into Adair and Dallas Counties as one of the cells advanced east-southeast.  The largest hail actually fell east of Casey in Guthrie County.  Softball size hail fell there, smashing windshields on numerous cars.  Needless to say, crop damage was widespread from west central into central Iowa along the paths of the two to three supercells that moved through the area.  Scattered crop damage occurred with the multi-cellular storms over central into northeast Iowa as well.  An example of the damage caused by the hail came by way of a report from Crawford County.   Reports indicated hail damaged 80,000 to 100,000 acres of crops with widespread damage.  Roads and ditches sustained between $150,000 and $200,000 in damage.  Tree removal in the county was #30,000, with $100,000 damage to homes and businesses in the county.  By the early evening, the weather system had made a transition from severe weather to heavy rain.  Intense rainfall occurred over northeast Iowa.  Flash flooding was widespread over northern Grundy, southern Butler, southern Bremer, and most of Black Hawk Counties.  A large swath of 6 to 8 inch rainfall occurred over the Beaver Creek basin, causing flash flooding in the area and an eventual flood of near record proportions.  County officials reported the flooding as very serious with countless roads and highways under water.  Cars were stranded and thousands of basements were flooded by the onslaught of heavy rain.  One report indicated several head of cattle lost as they were drown by the flood waters in Grundy County.  No doubt, this was not the only case of livestock loss due to the flooding.  Another report from the Dewar area, east of Waterloo, indicated about a block of railroad was washed out.  Damage there was reported to 33 houses, a car repair shop, and a tavern.  Rainfall was in excess of three inches per hour in many areas.  The heaviest rainfall officially was around 9 inches.  Some unofficial reports in the Cedar Falls area included up to 9 inches of rainfall in a 90 minute period.  The observer at Parkersburg picked up 6.55 inches of rain in under 3 hours.  A bucket survey in the area showed rainfall of 11 to 14 inches at a few locations in Butler County.  The heavy rain occurred as a series of storms formed and trained over the same areas.  The complex of thunderstorms that developed was a back developing complex.  Late in the life of the system, one of the storms became severe.  This storm displayed a meso circulation on the WSR-88D in Johnston, IA, though it was not all that well formed.  The storm was the last in the series of storms and layed down a path of damage.  The swath was about 13 miles long, extending across southern Butler and northern Grundy Counties.  The damage path looked to be more downburst in nature, though there were reports of a tornado imbedded in the flow pattern.  The situation was not all that different from the meso cyclone/tornado system that moved through Boone, Dallas, and Polk Counties about a year earlier on 29 June 1998.  The tornado caused damage to several farmsteads along the road.  The worst hit was on farmstead where all of the farm buildings were destroyed and only the superstructure of the farmhouse remained.  Debris was wrapped up in trees for many miles along the path.  One other tornado did occur earlier in the day.  The tornado came from one of the supercells over western Iowa.  A relatively small tornado touched down in Audubon County west of Hamlin.  There was little damage reported with this tornado.    ",356351

These winds blew around lawn furniture and damaged a residential porch. EPISODE NARRATIVE: A strong squall associated with a frontal boundary and weak upper level disturbance moved into the forecast area causing widespread severe weather and isolated flooding. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued at 6:10 PM CDT and remained in effect until 1 AM CDT and was then extended until 5 AM as the line continued to push south. Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area. 

As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Beall's Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people. 

As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area. A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night. 

The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area. 

Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a ???widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.??? 

While straight-line winds are common across West Texas ??? especially during the late spring and early summer ??? the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930. 

During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland???s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.

This front stalled south of Iowa and became a warm front during the day on the 5th.  The boundary set the stage for strong lift and thunderstorm development already by the morning of the 5th, and continued through the day.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with most unstable CAPE values rising to the 1000-2500 J/kg range by early afternoon.  There was considerable deep shear with 60 to 70 kts available in the 0-6 km layer.  The LCL level fell as the front lifted north, falling to 750 meters along the frontal boundary.  The initial severe weather that occurred was in the form of large hail.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was around 200 J/kg in a relatively low freezing level environment.  The freezing level was in the 10,000 to 12,000 foot range.  Considerable moisture streamed north to feed the storms.  In spite of the surface dews points north of the front in the upper 30s and 40s, readings in the 60s were found just south of the boundary.  Precipitable water values rose to 1.25 inches over southern Iowa by early afternoon.  Many of the storms produced hail, with numerous reports in the one inch to golf ball size category.  The largest hail occurred over south central Iowa with golf ball size hail reported in Clarke County.  A secondary round of storms moved through south central into central Iowa by mid afternoon.  One of the storms dropped golf ball size hail in Marion County as well, completely covering the ground.  The same cluster of storms continued northeast with large hail reported.  Half dollar size hail covered the ground in Poweshiek County near Deep River.  Another round of thunderstorms developed over northeast Iowa during the afternoon, but they only produced some small hail.  Thunderstorm activity decreased during the early evening hours, but began to fire again after sunset as the low level jet developed.  Surface windEVENT NARRATIVE: ",799830

Synoptic and mesoscale conditions during the afternoon of the 9th...

A significant mid-level shortwave trough extended through the Mississippi valley during the afternoon with a deepening surface low over northeast Illinois.  Northwest Ohio was in the warm sector with surface based CAPE of 2500 J/kg and increasing deep layer shear in advance of a 70 knot mid-level jet max ahead of the mid-level shortwave.  

A prefrontal squall line quickly developed late in the afternoon along the Illinois/Indiana state line.  Additional isolated supercells developed in advance of this line and were mainly responsible for the swath of large hail from Wabash to Steuben counties. The squall line gradually organized into a large bow echo with the apex of the bow tracking from southwest Whitley county eastward through northern Allen and into western Defiance county in Ohio were the greatest widespread wind damage was observed. A bow echo/supercell merger occurred over northwest Williams county causing extensive damage in Montpelier and Columbia.",401887

Summary of events for the evening of June 8 and the early morning of June 9 1998:

A classic southern plains severe weather event shaped up on the afternoon and evening of June 8 as a number of isolated severe thunderstorms developed over central Oklahoma to the east of a dryline.  

The first severe thunderstorm to affect eastern Oklahoma scraped the northwestern part of Osage County, causing a report of a severe thunderstorm gust.  This storm quickly died as it entered Kansas.

A second more serious severe thunderstorm formed west of Oklahoma City and tracked all the way to the Arkansas state line south of Fort Smith, traversing Pittsburg, Haskell, and Le Flore Counties.  This storm travelled east along an instability axis and a warm front.  From a radar perspective, this storm was impressive in that it kept a classic, well-defined hook on its entire journey across southeast Oklahoma.  From a human perspective, this storm was impressive in that it produced ten tornadoes in southeast Oklahoma, hail as large as golfballs, damaging thunderstorm winds, and torrential flooding rains.

A third cluster of severe thunderstorms developed over Creek County and moved east across Okmulgee, Muskogee, Cherokee, and Adair Counties before weakening as it entered Arkansas.  These storms slowed their movement across Muskogee County and regeneration along the southwest flank of the storms caused torrential rainfalls that dumped nearly three inches of rain in northern Muskogee, southern Cherokee, southern Adair, and northern Sequoyah Counties.  In addition to flooding rains, these storms produced hail as large as nickels and damaging thunderstorm winds.",336425

Severe thunderstorms affected parts of western and central Oklahoma from late afternoon of the 21st through the early morning of the 22nd. An F2 tornado that struck the town of Carrier in Garfield County received the most attention, however 2 other tornadoes did form, and there were many reports of damaging straight-line winds and large, destructive hail. A team of National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed the damage in and near Carrier and rated the tornado an F2. The tornado developed at 1745 CST approximately 4 miles west-southwest of Carrier. The tornado moved along a path from west-southwest to east-northeast from its starting point to Carrier. The path width was approximately 150 yards wide early in the tornado's life. At a point 2 miles southwest of Carrier F2 damage was observed. A home had its roof ripped off and two walls collapsed. As the tornado began to approach Carrier it widened to approximately 500 yards. Four homes in Carrier lost all of their roofs with all four walls standing. One older abandoned cinder block building collapsed. A school and church on the north side of Carrier suffered only minor roof or window damage. As the storm moved out of Carrier it turned to the northeast and narrowed to 200 yards. At about 2 miles northeast of Carrier one home had significant damage to its roof while another suffered minor roof damage. The tornado was rated F1 at this point.The tornado dissipated at 1805 CST about 4 miles northeast of Carrier. The combination of the tornado and straight-line winds in believed to have been responsible for the majority of damage.  After the tornado dissipated, straight-line winds continued to cause some damage for several miles. Significant tree damage was noted 4 miles east northeast of Carrier which was one and a half miles south of the tornado damage path. In total 8 homes and businesses were destroyed; 14 buildings sustained major damage, while 19 others sustained minor damage. Damage is estimated at 1.5 million dollars.

Another tornado, an F0, was reported by Garfield County Emergency Management causing minor damage to roofs of 2 homes west-northwest of Vance Air Force Base. The 3rd and last tornado of the day, an F1, touched down about 1 mile northeast of Billings in Noble County and destroyed a barn and 2 outbuildings. In addition trees were blown down and several house windows were blown out; numerous farm animals were killed, and 2 semis were blown over on Interstate 35 near mile marker 207. The driver of one of the trucks was injured by broken glass. In addition to tornadoes, large and destructive hail fell in many areas including Hennessey in Kingfisher County where an unusually large amount of golf ball to baseball-size hail fell several times on the 21st causing extensive damage to vehicles, homes, and wheat crop. At least 900,000 dollars is expected to be paid out by just one insurance company which received nearly 750 claims. Among the list of hail damage reports: a pick-up truck was struck by golf ball-size hail 6 miles west of Lacey in Kingfisher County, and numerous vehicles had their windows broken by tennis ball-size hail 16 miles west of Hennessey, also in Kingfisher County.

Damaging straight-line winds were observed by the Chief of the Kremlin Fire Department in Garfield County who experienced a brief period of 70 to 80 mph winds from the northwest near the intersection of Highway 81 and Great Lakes Road 8 miles south of Kremlin. He also witnessed an old barn being blown over. Power lines were also downed on the north side of Enid in Garfield County. A wind gust of 90 mph was also observed at the Stillwater Regional Airport in Payne County, where many signs were blown down.",368550

The tornado touched down north of Route 850 in Perry County, between VFW Drive and Mountaindale Drive. The tornado tracked to the northeast, lifting occasionally as it moved across eastern Perry County and eventually to the Susquehanna River. The path indicated the tornado lifted and touched down several times. Damage was limited mainly to over 100 trees, which were snapped and uprooted. Photographic evidence helped in making the tornado declaration.  

After crossing the Susquehanna River, the tornado touched down again in Dauphin Borough. Examination of the damage here indicated the tornado touched down again about one quarter mile east of Dauphin Borough on River Road. The tornado continued east about 1.5 miles...generally following Hillside Road...and dissipating as it began to climb Second Mountain. Six homes suffered moderate to major damage, and 150 trees were downed. Storm damage was consistent with maximum winds of around 90 mph. There were no injuries or fatalities.

Along nearly the entire length of this north-south oriented squall line were estimated or measured wind gusts of 60-80 MPH, with automated equipment at the Lexington airport recording the highest-known measured gust of 90 MPH. As a result, widespread wind damage primarily to trees, power lines and outbuildings occurred across multiple counties. Although there several preliminary reports of brief tornadoes along the leading edge of the squall line, including one near Cozad early in the evening, radar data along with photographic and video evidence suggests that the vast majority of these reports were actually gustnadoes, which are brief, but sometimes strong circulations associated with outflow and not connected to cloud base rotation. Most of these gustnado reports focused west of the Highway 281 corridor. In addition, there were also sporadic reports of quarter size hail, but damaging straight-line wind along the surging outflow was the main story by far. Just to name a few, wind highlights included: a measured 74 MPH gust at Central Nebraska Regional Airport in Grand Island with several reports of structural damage within the city including a destroyed mini-storage building; a measured gust to 83 MPH at the Ord airport with considerable damage to a hangar; three empty grain bins blown off their foundations and an unsecured trailer rolled near Strang in Fillmore County. 

Focusing on timing, the initial severe storm development took place across north central Nebraska during mid-afternoon, with the developing severe squall line first creeping southward into western Dawson County around 7 PM CDT. Thereafter, the line continued to build south into Kansas as it marched east, crossing the Highway 281 corridor maiEVENT NARRATIVE: Wind gusts were estimated at 60 MPH, knocking down tree limbs between 5 and 6 inches in diameter.",861958

About five to ten inches of snow fell across the region. The combination of strong winds and heavy snow made travel difficult at best and made it tough for road crews to keep thoroughfares opened. There were many fender benders and vehicles that slid off roads. More than 300 accidents were reported statewide. The Mid-Atlantic AAA responded to 2,600 calls for assistance throughout their region. All schools as well as many state, county and municipal offices were closed on Monday March 2nd. Many businesses and colleges were also closed. Many daytime and evening meetings were postponed. Schools did not reopen until the 4th in New Castle and Kent Counties and the 5th in Sussex County. 

Precipitation began as a mixture of rain and sleet across the lower part of the state and just plain snow in the northern part of the state during the late afternoon and early evening of the 1st. The mixed precipitation changed to all snow by the start of the evening of the 1st and fell heavy at times during the evening and overnight as gravity wave bands of heavier snow moved through the region. Snow of generally lighter intensity fell during the day on the 2nd, before it ended during the late afternoon.

In New Castle County, there were 80 reported snow related accidents, six of them caused injuries. In Kent County, there were 122 snow related accidents. Fifty-six of those resulted in vehicular damage and two had injuries. There was also 64 reported disabled vehicles. In Sussex County, road crews had a difficult time keeping roadways open as considerable drifting occurred, especially in the western part of the county. There were 183 reported snow related accidents, 106 of which resulted in vehicular damage and four injuries. There were also 73 disabled vehicles. Mailboxes were also not immune as 58 of them were damaged during plowing operations.

This event was forced by unseasonably strong wind fields associated with a potent extra-tropical cyclone that was formerly Tropical Storm Lee.  Post-tropical cyclone Lee was moving slowly toward the east-northeast along the north central Gulf Coast during the morning hours of September 5, 2011.  By 3:00 pm EDT (1900 UTC), the cyclone was centered near Mobile Bay.  It was at this point that the system finally began to accelerate off to the northeast.  While tornadoes were initially considered to be the primary threat, examination of a special 1800 UTC KTAE sounding showed that low level winds had veered and that the flow was unidirectional through a deep layer.  WFO Tallahassee coordinated with the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) to replace the existing tornado watch with a severe thunderstorm watch at 4:00 pm EDT (2000 UTC).  WFO Tallahassee issued a total of 35 convective warnings during the event along with several special marine warnings.  A total of 52 severe weather reports were received across southeast Alabama, southwest and south central Georgia, and the Florida panhandle and big bend.  

Aside from the severe weather, the forecast area experienced other peripheral impacts from post-tropical storm Lee. Widespread storm-total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches was measured across the Florida panhandle and big bend, with 1 to 2 inch totals more common across the Alabama and Georgia portions of the CWA.  The Apalachicola and Cedar Key tide gauges showed that tidal departures ran just over 2 feet above normal along the Florida big bend coastline during the high tide cycle of Tuesday morning, September 6. For the most part, flooding was avoided. The water rose up to the top of the sea walls in Dixie County, and there was some minor flooding in Wakulla County where the emergency manager reported about a 2-inch over-washEVENT NARRATIVE: A 72 hour rainfall total of 4.32 inches was reported by CoCoRaHS site FLWK04.",897182

Surface temperatures warmed into the 80s with dew point readings in the low to mid 70s.  A semi-stationary front extended northeast from the low, across northern Iowa during the afternoon into the evening hours.  The atmosphere became very unstable with MUCAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range by mid afternoon and lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear was quite high, between 40 and 70 kts.  Downdraft CAPW was between 1000 and 1300 J/kg with cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere around 400 J/kg.  The LCL was in the 750 to 1000 meter range, with the lowest over north central Iowa.  With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.  A second death occurred in Wright County as a 50 year old male farmer near Galt was sucked into a culvert by flood waters as he checked the field tiles in his farm field.",704087

Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches were common for the two-day period. In a broad swath from southwest Arkansas through the central part of the state into northeast Arkansas, many places picked up 7 to 10 inches of rain. Flash flooding resulted initially, followed by areal flooding and river flooding. After the low passed by, colder air spilled into Arkansas. Light snow fell across parts of northern and western Arkansas from late on the 24th into the early morning hours of Christmas Day.

The airmass became very unstable with the lifted index falling to around -8 and CAPE in excess of 4000 J/kg.  The atmosphere was quite warm with the freezing level between 15,000 and 16,000 feet.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was around 600 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was quite high, in the 1200 to 1500 J/kg range.

During the night, the low level jet increased to 70 kts, further feeding the thunderstorms.  A large complex of thunderstorms developed across South Dakota into Nebraska.  It moved southeast into the rich air over Iowa and accelerated, becoming a derecho.  A large area of high winds developed with widespread wind gusts of 60 to 75 MPH, mainly over the southwest half of the CWA.  The storms also produced hail at most locations as it passed.  Most of the hail was around an inch or so in diameter.  A smaller area of thunderstorms formed over southeast Iowa, ahead of the main area.  These storms produced hail up to golf ball in size, along with 60 MPH winds during the early evening.  The largest hail reported was 2 inches in diameter in Cincinnati in Appanoose County.  The storms produced copious rainfall in spite of their rapid movement.  Flash flooding was reported in Union, Adair, Davis, and Adams Counties.  For the most part the flash flooding was relatively minor, limited to water flowing rapidly over roads.  In Davis County at Bloomfield, water blew off manhole covers and was deep enough to nearly reach the tops of car roofs.  The thunderstorm winds caused widespread damage to trees and power lines.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds EVENT NARRATIVE: A 74-year-old Edison man died of a heart attack on the morning of the 28th after he spent most of the overnight bailing water from his basement.  Every municipality in Middlesex County had flooding problems and in addition half the county lost power. Major roadways that were closed due to flooding included U.S, Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Routes 18 and 27.  Monroe Township was one of the harder hit townships in Middlesex County as flooding along the Manalapan and Matchaponix Brooks affected 200 homes.  Eleven homes were uninhabitable and a Tyndale Avenue home was knocked off its foundation. In Woodbridge, the Woodbridge River flooded. In the Avenel section of the township, the Ideal Mobile Home development was evacuated. In Old Bridge Township, flooding along the South River isolated four blocks in the township and moved two homes off their foundation. In Spotswood Borough, the historical Saint Peter's Episcopal Church was badly damaged


The main stem of the Raritan River had major flooding and its second highest crest on record only surpassed by the flooding during Hurricane Floyd in September of 1999.

An intense line of severe thunderstorms oriented from north to south developed during Labor Day afternoon ahead of a strong approaching cold front.  As the storms moved east at 40 to 50 mph, they produced high winds, large hail, and isolated tornadoes.  Wind gusts from 60 to 80 mph combined with hail up to 1.75 inches in diameter caused damage to houses (roofs and gutters), trees, and power lines across the region.  The cost estimates of damage included above are preliminary figures submitted by the Union County Office of Emergency Management.

In Essex County, the following peak wind gusts were reported:  74 mph at West Orange and 68 mph in Millburn.  High winds downed trees in Newark.

In Union County, the following peak wind gusts were reported:  72 mph in Roselle, 71 mph in Garwood, 70 mph in Mountainside, and 69 mph in Elizabeth.  High winds caused a Tommy Hilfiger Blimp to break loose from its' mooring at Linden Airport.  When it struck a power line, the blimp was destroyed.  Officials said it may cost up to $8M to fix.  Small planes also toppled over at Linden Airport.  A trailer was overturned in Linden.  High winds also caused a tree to fall into and damage a house on Church Street in Rahway.  Preliminary cost damage estimates for Rahway range from $700K to $1M based on newspaper articles.  The combination of high winds and large hail damaged roofs and gutters in Roselle.  Large hail also fell:  1.75-inch in diameter at Union City, 1.25-inch in diameter was reported at both Mountainside and Garwood and 1.00-inch in diameter was reported in Roselle.

The situation worsened Saturday evening into Sunday as heavy rain associated with the upper low pressure system redeveloped over the western Texas Hill Country.  Very heavy rains over the Texas Hill Country Saturday night and Sunday morning caused widespread flooding as well as flash flooding across numerous counties.  The heavy rains moved into San Antonio Sunday morning and into the Austin area later in the morning.  By Sunday afternoon and evening, areas of showers and thunderstorms had diminished over South Central Texas as the upper low moved into North Texas.   Late Sunday evening, they again developed over the Texas Hill Country, producing additional severe flooding and flash flooding late Sunday night into Monday morning.

Rainfall amounts for the three rain events, including the period from Friday through Monday, averaged between 4 and 6 inces, with over 15 inches across many locations in the Texas Hill Country.  The least amount of rain fell in the Del Rio area, west of the low, while the most rain fell over parts of the Texas Hill Country.  The heaviest rain amounts fell in Bandera County, where over 20 inches was reported.  Bandera measured 19.47 inches of rain in 2 days, while 21 inches of rain was measured 4 miles west of Tarpley in Bandera County.

Guadalupe River...
The Guadalupe River first crested at Comfort at 25.9 feet (73,640 cfs) early on June 22nd, then an additional 4.5 inches of rain in the Cypress Creek drainage sent a flood wave downstream that flooded homes in Comfort.   Downstream, the Guadalupe at Spring Branch rose to within a foot of the flood of record, 45.45 feet.  Canyon Lake rose to within 5 feet of the record elevation and within 6 feet of the emergency spillway height.

Cibolo Creek...
A general rainfall of 12 to 15 inches between Bandera and Boerne, with up to 20 inches west of Boerne, produced flooding along Cibolo Creek that filled two flood retention dams as well as Boerne City Lake.  The Boerne Police Chief was trapped in his home by the flood wave down the spillway, and reported a television set washing through the window of one of the flooded homes.   Cibolo Creek in Boerne crested at over 16 feet, the highest level since 1964.  About 20 percent of the homes facing Cibolo Creek were flooded to some extent.  Downstream, the Creek flooded several homes in Bulverde.  The most massive damage was in Schertz, where blocks of the Pecan Grove Trailer Park were inundated.    Trailers washed downstream into each other,  lodging in trees.   The Red Cross reported 330 persons evacuated and seeking alternate housing.   The flood wave reached LaVernia early Monday afternoon, flooding two homes, and causing 25 families to be evacuated.

Medina River...
No homes were flooded in Bandera, however, several trailer camps were flooded.  By Sunday, all the city park was evacuated.  Bandera received a storm total of 19.47 inches for the two days.  Although the city of Bandera did not receive large flood damage, Bandera County was very hard hit.   About four miles west of Boerne, Castle Lake Dam failed, sending a large wave down Bear Creek and washing out a road and bridge.  Downstream, Privilege Creek washed out a primary bridge on SH16 at Pipe Creek.   Bridges were washed out on nearly every creek in Eastern Bandera County.  A few homes were flooded as Medina Lake crested by mid afternoon on Sunday.

Leon Creek in Bexar County....
Leon creek flooded a trailer park in western San Antonio as well as homes in Rodriguez Park area.  Water also got just to the slab of the jet engine test facility at Kelly AFB.  The gauge at IH35 crested at 1930 CST at 24.61 feet, exceeding the flood of record set in 1987.

Hondo Creek...
Although Hondo Creek did no structural damage near Hondo, it did close Hwy 90 for a while.   The main problems were along Quihi Creek and Seco Creek.   Quihi Creek flooded homes and caused evacuations in Quihi, about 8 miles northeast of Hondo.   

Seco Creek...
The town of D'Hanis was so completely under water that someone could have ridden a boat down main street.  This was the fourth such occurrence since 1932.    The high water mark on businesses on main street was around 2.5 feet above the road on the store fronts.   The bank reported about 6 inches of water in it. D'Hanis was inundated by Parker Creek from the east first, then Seco Creek flooded the town from the west.  Although every building in town suffered damage, no lives were lost.

Sabinal River...
Residents in Sabinal reported no known flooding problems in the near Sabinal.    However there were reports of many evacuations of homes and mobile homes.  Severe flooding was reported upstream near Utopia, where recreation camps were badly damaged.  A park ranger in Garner State Park reported that 31 cars were washed downstream.  The River at the highway 90 gauge showed massive lowland flooding, with trees stripped of bark, and evidence of debris high in the trees.  The Sabinal River at Sabinal crested at 33.12 feet, just 2 inches below the flood of record of 1958.

Frio River...
Uvalde County deputies spent several hours rescuing people from trees along the Frio River in the northern part of the county.  Numerous helicopter rescues were also required.  Indications are that the same tremendous rain that involved the Sabinal River, also fell in the Frio River tributaries east of the mainstem near Leakey.   Rainfall was quite variable but reports point to massive rainfall and flooding along the Frio, and its tributaries.  The heavy rain area extended from Camp Wood along the escarpment to near Boerne.   The high water mark in Garner State Park was 15 feet above the low dam and about 3 feet up the restroom walls.  Some restrooms were washed downstream and wrecked trailers were found along the bank, and even  lodged several feet up in a tree.

Nueces River...
The headwaters of the Nueces River above Camp Wood also received very heavy rainfall.   Again, numerous homes were flooded and rescues required along the river in Uvalde County, although less than had occurred along the Frio River.

Pedernales River...
A brief burst of between 6 and 12 inches of rain in the Pedernales River headwaters early Sunday morning above Harper sent near record flooding downstream.  The Pedernales River at Fredericksburg crested early Sunday morning, with the flood damage not serious until the wave reached LBJ National Park, near Stonewall.   A 22 foot rise was reported downstream at the higher bridge.   Inside the park, several concrete and steel signs were damaged, and there was also significant damage to roads.  At Johnson City, the crest was well below the 1952 flood of record and there was no significant damage in this reach. 

Llano River...
Tremendous flow down the James River, reinforced by 8 to 15 inch rainfall east of Mason Sunday afternoon and evening, sent the Llano River at Llano to over 38 feet shortly near midnight Sunday night, some 6 feet above the 1952 flood of record.   Several buildings and a dozen homes were flooded in Llano, and major damage was reported to the city park.   At least two dozen homes were flooded between Llano and Castell and 5 to 6 homes flooded south of Llano.  At Kingsland, complete destruction was reported to docks along the River above Lake LBJ.   Most boats were destroyed, although no homes were flooded.  Along the Colorado River, over a dozen homes and lodges were flooded.   Flooding along Lake Marble Falls on the north side of Lake LBJ, involved some 35 homes on one side alone.  At Lake Marble Falls, inflow was so great that the lake volume was being replaced every 12 minutes on Sunday evening.   

An additional rainfall amounts of up to six inches fell south of the San Antonio area between 9 am and noon on Sunday.   Although Saturday's flooding fell on relatively sparsely populated ranch land, the flooding on Sunday fell in highly populated river recreational areas, filled with weekend campers.  Most roads in Frio and Atascosa counties were closed with several homes flooded in Dilley.  The flooding moved eastward on Monday into DeWitt and Lavaca Counties.  Rainfall for the two days in the two counties averaged from 3 to 6 inches, with isolated totals of up to 12 inches.  Massive flooding was reported on Coleto Creek and Sandies Creek.  The Navidad River In Lavaca County crested 2 feet above flood stage, causing widespread lowland flooding.

The Red Cross and FEMA totals for homes and businesses damaged or destroyed in this flood in South Central Texas included nearly 300 homes across the Highland Lakes northwest of the Austin area.  In addition, homes and businesses damaged or destroyed numbered approximately 200 in Guadalupe County, 150 in each of Bandera and Bexar Counties,  100 in each of Medina and Kendall Counties, and 50 in each of Real, Uvalde and Comal Counties.

A 76-year old man in Medina County was drowned in the early morning on Sunday.  He was in a vehicle with his wife near 130 am CST and apparently drove around a barrier on Hondo Creek about 4 miles south of Yancey on FM462.  The vehicle was swept into the creek and his wife was able to climb out of the vehicle after it came to rest along a fence about 50 feet downstream.  Her husband was unable to escape.

The flooding claimed a victim in Bandera County during the early morning hours on Sunday. Someone had reported seeing a car with a man and his wife swept off SH16 over Bandera Creek, at the eastern edge of Bandera.   When firemen and deputies arrived on the scene, they heard a call for help from the man who had caught onto a tree.  The woman, 59 years old and unable to escape from the vehicle, was drowned.

A third death during the Hill Country rain event also occurred in the early morning hours in Bandera County.  A 41-year old man and his friend were driving in a truck on HWY 16.  Flooding waters out of Privilege Creek swept the car off the bridge and into the creek.  One of the two men was able to swim to safety, but the other drowned.  This occurred within about 4 miles of the site where the woman drowned.

Heavy snow was also observed over parts of the northeast Colorado plains, where storm totals ranged from 4 to 10 inches.  Gusty winds also produced blizzard conditions along the Cheyenne Ridge and Palmer Divide.  Poor road conditions forced the closure of Interstate 25, from Wellington to the Wyoming state line.  Approximately 5 thousand Xcel Energy customers reported power outages in and around Greeley. In addition, the snow and blowing snow forced several school closures in Douglas and Weld Counties.  Snow drifts, from 1 to 3 feet deep were reported in the northern portion of Douglas and Elbert Counties.

Some of the storm totals included:  14 inches, 4 miles south of Boulder and 12.5 miles northwest of Golden, 13 inches, 5 miles east-southeast of Aspen Springs; 12 inches near Allenspark and Parker; 11 inches, 6 miles southwest of Castle Rock, Gennessee, 9 miles north-northeast of Elizabeth, 10 inches, 7 miles south of Sedalia and 10 miles south-southeast of Buckley AFB.

Another round of severe thunderstorms developed late in the afternoon as a dry line approached the area from the west. Extreme instability and strong vertical wind shear resulted in the development of long-lived supercell thunderstorms that moved across eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas during the late afternoon and evening. Several of these supercells became tornadic and a few produced long-lived damaging tornadoes. 

One such supercell developed and moved along the Oklahoma-Kansas border and then into southwestern Missouri. This storm produced a tornado in northeastern Craig County OK that remained on the ground for 29 miles in Oklahoma, continued for about 31 miles in Newton County MO, and finally dissipated about 15 miles into Barry County MO. It produced EF-4 damage in several locations, including Picher, a small town in north-central Ottawa County OK. Twenty-one fatalities, over 350 injuries, and an estimated $60 million in property damage resulted from this tornado in Oklahoma and Missouri. Six of the fatalities and about 150 injuries occurred in Picher OK.

Other strong tornadoes developed and moved across portions of Pittsburg and Latimer Counties. A EF-2 tornado was on the ground for about eight miles west of McAlester, damaging numerous homes in its path. Another EF-2 tornado developed southwest of Hartshorne in Pittsburg County and moved 19 miles before dissipating just east of Yanush in Latimer County.

The front slowed down, which prolonged the rain. The result was widespread flash flooding, which gave way to areal flooding and river flooding. Winds changed direction and speed up through the atmosphere, a favorable condition for tornadoes. However, instability was sufficient only in southern Arkansas for the development of tornadoes.EVENT NARRATIVE: Flooding on the Spring River at Hardy washed out Loberg Park, destroying the fence around the park, damaging playground equipment and partially washing out trails in the park.

Summary of events for January 21 1999:

Three rounds of severe thunderstorms moved across west-central Arkansas during the evening of January 21.  The first severe thunderstorm moved across southern and eastern Sebastian County, eventually exiting Franklin County just north of Altus from 630 to 745 PM.  Along the way, this storm produced golfball-sized hail and a brief tornado touchdown.  The second severe storm followed a similar path but just a little further south from 730 to 845 PM.  This storm produced hail as large as baseballs at Milltown.  The final severe thunderstorm was more like a short line, causing two reports of nickel-sized hail from opposite ends of Sebastian County and a report of strong winds as it passed through from 1000 to 1045 PM.

While severe thunderstorms in January are unusual, the right conditions came together when a dryline moved into very unstable air and then a powerful upper level jet approached the area.  The report of baseball-sized hail was the first time that hail that large had ever been reported in the modernized Tulsa County Warning Area during the month of January.",349224

Some of the highest reported totals for the 24-hour period ending on the morning of the 25th included 5 inches at both Osceola and Benedict, and 4 inches at Fullerton and York. In contrast, only minimal accumulations from a trace to around 1 inch fell across areas generally south of a Gothenburg-Hastings-Geneva line, partly due to warmer temperatures that kept some of the precipitation as light rain.  The instigator for this slushy snow event was a low amplitude mid level shortwave trough passing through the region, which generated a fairly pronounced zone of low to mid level  isentropic lift and warm air advection. As it turned out, this snow event served as the opening act to an unseasonably cold 5-day stretch lasting through the 29th, during which most of South Central Nebraska endured high temperatures only in the 30s each day, along with a few rounds of light snow. For most of the area, this was the overall coldest last week of March since 1987.EVENT NARRATIVE: Snowfall totals ranged from 3 to 6 inches around the county.",847765

The clusters or short lines of storms moved east at a speed of about 30 knots (35 mph), and generated damaging downburst straight-line winds that toppled trees and power-lines, and heavy rains that triggered flash flooding.  Synoptically, a stationary front stretched from northern Iowa to Wisconsin/Illinois border.  Warm, moist, unstable air flowed north over the front in association with an upper-level short-wave trough, resulting in thunderstorm generation.  Hourly rainfall rates peaked around 2 inches.

By the end of August, 2007, many locations in south-central and southeast Wisconsin would establish new August rainfall records, and all-time/any month rainfall records.

To make matters worse, east winds gusting over 50 mph, combined with the heavy ice accumulation, brought down numerous tree branches and power lines, along with several thousand power poles. There were even whole trees crashing down from the weight of the ice. Widespread power outages occurred, affecting over 180,000 people, which lasted more than a week in some of the rural areas. Many shelters were opened to accommodate those without power. The governor of Iowa declared much of the state a disaster area, and requested President Bush to declare much of eastern Iowa a federal disaster area. In the northern portions of the region in the colder air, snow was the problem. Accumulations of up to 7 inches occurred, with strong winds combining to create blizzard conditions.

The thunderstorms that were over southern Iowa moved northeast, with the precipitation changing over to snow in central  Iowa.  Bands of snow lifted northeast across the area through the night.  As the storm system matured, the dry slot swept out of the southern Plains into Illinois.  A deformation zone set up along the northwest edge of the dry slot with heavy snow setting up in a band from west central into northeast Iowa.  Snow fell at the rate of one to two inches an hour for a period of time.  Snowfall in the area was generally in the 6 to 9 inch range.  The heaviest snow fell in a band about 30 miles wide extending from near Boone, east-northeast to just south of Waterloo.  Numerous reports of 8.5 to 9 inches of snow were received from this area.  The heaviest snowfall total came from Boone with 10 inches.  An official report from Ames came in at 9 inches.  Late in the storms life cycle, snow sank south and moved into southern Iowa.  A few areas west of Ottumwa to near Albia received a total of 6 to 7 inches of snow during a 21 hour period.  The later areas were most affected by the ice storm mentioned above however.  Fortunately, this storm system was not a typical February snowstorm.  Northeast to north winds of 15 to 25 MPH caused some blowing and drifting snow, however this did not cause major problems.  Most schools and some businesses either closed or started late due to the snow.  Though there was some disruption, by Iowa standards the storm was not a major event.  Damage was limited from the storm.  Though the snow was very wet and heavy, amounts were not great enough to cause major damage dow to loading.  ",387304

As these storms reached central Oklahoma, straight-line winds caused minor tree damage 5 miles northwest of Edmond in northwest Oklahoma County. At 1836 CST, a tornado formed 5 miles southwest of Seward in Logan County, near Western and Simmons Road where a shed was damaged. The tornado, rated F1, then tracked north-northeast for 4 miles before dissipating 1 mile southwest of Seward. Tree damage was observed at a home along Sante Fe Avenue, and a sign was damaged at Sante Fe and EW86 Road. The tornado continued north-northeast inflicting tree damage as it crossed EW85 Road between Santa Fe and Kelley, then dissipated between EW85 and EW84 Roads. Near the end of the tornado's path, a one-mile width of straight-line wind damage, consisting of scattered, light tree damage, was observed southwest of Seward along EW85 Road and between Sante Fe and Kelley Roads. Small trees were also damaged by straight-line winds near the intersection of Sante Fe and Seward Road, or about 1.5 miles west of Seward.

Another tornado then formed in Logan County about 6 miles southwest of downtown Guthrie along Kelley Avenue and about 1.2 miles south of Prarie Grove Road, where outbuildings received light damage. Very light damage was noted on Prairie Grove Road between Kelley and Broadway, and three power poles were downed along Industrial Road. The tornado crossed State Highway 33 where power poles were again downed. As it crossed State Highway 33, the tornado moved into the Cimarron National Golf Course and  tracked down the 16th fairway. There was widespread tree damage along the eastern-most four holes of the golf course, and light damage to an outbuilding on the fringe of the tornado's path. The tornado then moved into a neighborhood adjacent to the golf course where a number of homes were damaged. One house, located on Canyon Road, suffered significant damage (rated F2) with most of the roof removed and some light damage to the walls. There was a minor injury reported at this home where a woman was cut by flying glass as she ran to take shelter. Two adjacent houses suffered roof damage. The framing to one home under construction was knocked off-center, and another house under construction received roof damage. The homes in this area looked to be well-built and of typical construction for newer homes. As the tornado traveled north-northeast, an old farmhouse on College Avenue received some minor roof and wall damage before the tornado crossed the Cimarron River. On the north side of the river, a mobile home roof was peeled off, and a permanent home received some minor damage along EW76 Road just to the east of NS311 Road. From this point northeast, damage was confined to trees in this rural area of Logan County. The tornado is believed to have crossed US Highway 77 once, and then dissipated in the Cimarron River Valley, traveling a distance of 12 miles.

The third and final tornado of the day formed near EW55 Road and west of NS323 Road, or about 5 miles south-southeast of Perry in Noble County Oklahoma along North Stillwater Creek, producing tree damage. The tornado passed just west of the intersection of EW54 Road and NS323 Road, where a residential windmill and a hay barn were destroyed. Several 1500 pound cylindrical hay bales were blown 100 feet. The width of damage was estimated at 50 to 75 yards at this point. Sheet metal from the hay barn originally at this location was found 1/2 to 3/4 mile to the northeast along the west side of NS323 Road. Across the street (east) from the sheet metal remains of the hay barn, a metal frame/sheet metal exterior hay barn was pushed over to the north and the roof removed. One half mile north on EW53 Road, two wood utility poles were down. Sheet metal debris and grass caught in the barb wire fence indicated winds from the south-southwest. A total of 19 metal utility poles were blown over to the north along EW51 Road. The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 64 three miles east of downtown Perry, or at the intersection of NS324 Road. Damage width was estimated at 100 yards. A pole barn building used for auto repair was destroyed. Construction of this building consisted of 6x6 wooden uprights embedded in cement with a sheet metal exterior. Most of the building was carried away with a small amount of debris deposited on the north side of the slab. The owner stated that some of the 6x6 uprights were rotted near the footings. Across NS324 Road to the east of the auto repair building, a sheet metal hay barn lost its roof, and several smaller outbuildings were destroyed. Across Highway 64 to the northwest, a home suffered minor tree damage; a satellite dish was blown over and bent, and there was major damage to an outbuilding which was pushed over from the southwest. The tornado continued north crossing EW49 Road removing the roof from a hay barn and causing extensive tree damage. This F0 to low end F1 damage occurred in a 300 yard wide path at this point. One mile north on EW48 Road, a pole barn lost its roof and three walls, and extensive tree damage was noted. Two miles north, just south of EW46 Road, widespread, major tree damage was observed in a grove of trees along Black Bear Creek, and also on EW46 Road, where a hay barn filled with hay was destroyed. The tornado weakened rapidly after this point as it moved northeast, with the damage path ending somewhere just west of Red Rock Road (NS327 Road) and north of EW45 Road.

Northward in Kay County, straight-line winds destroyed a shed 4 miles east of Ponca City, and power lines were downed in Kaw City, while in Pottawatomie County power lines and 1 tree were downed at Wolverine and Leo Streets in downtown Shawnee, interrupting power to about 300 residences. Also in Shawnee, lightning struck a high-voltage conductor which fell onto a power line leading into several homes. Many of these homes received damage to appliances and electrical systems.",370311

This front became stationary near the Saint Lawrence River Valley and northern New England.  A disturbance in the upper levels of the atmosphere and an area of low pressure moving towards the Great Lakes Region focused another round of showers and thunderstorms that impacted the western and central Mohawk Valley, Adirondack region, and the Upper Hudson River Valley including the Lake George Region late Wednesday afternoon into the early evening, April 27th.

Another wave of low pressure moved into the eastern Great Lakes Region Thursday morning, April 28th.  This low intensified as it approached and had strong upper level support favorable for strong to severe thunderstorms.  A supercell thunderstorm produced a tornado that  touched down in southern Herkimer County producing damage in Frankfort early in the morning. Severe thunderstorms produced damaging winds north and west of the Capital Region during the morning hours. Very heavy rainfall was associated with the storms. 

Lightning strikes started fires in a couple locations. The Mayfield Presbyterian Church in Fulton County was destroyed and the Stuyvesant Reformed Church in Columbia County suffered minimal damage.
 
On June 10th, The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that federal disaster assistance had been made available to the state of New York to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by storms, flooding, tornadoes, and straight-line winds during the period of April 26 to May 8, 2011.

A very unstable air mass was present over South Texas (CAPE values from 4500 to 5500 J/kg).  At 7 pm CDT, the first line of thunderstorms entered the Rio Grande Valley and produced hail up to the size of nickels, localized flooding and strong winds.  The second line of thunderstorms extended across much of Central Texas and began accelerating and tracking southward from Tilden to Goliad by late in the evening.  The two lines of thunderstorms merged around Tilden and Choke Canyon Reservoir near 1000 pm CDT causing intensification to the convective complex of storms.  This was evident by severe storms over Live Oak and Bee counties with increased reflectivity and cloud to ground lightning between 1030 and 1100 pm CDT.  At the same time, the northern
line of thunderstorms continued through the Victoria Crossroads area and slowly weakened.

The strongest portion of the solid line of thunderstorms continued southeastward into the central Coastal Bend. Reports of trees down and power outages increased from along I-37 to Corpus Christi from the most intense portion of the line of thunderstorms.  WSR-88D detected small areas of rotation over Aransas, San Patricio and Nueces Counties between 1100 and  midnight CDT when tornado warnings were issued.  Wind gusts of 60 mph were common from automated weather stations as the storms slammed the lower Coastal Bend.  Power outages from the wind were significant by midnight and there were many reports of trees and power lines down, and rescue operations for recreational trailers that were tipped over on the base of Navy Corpus Christi and a flipped 18-wheeler. In this area, automated sensors measured wind as high as 80 mph.  The lightning was intense and continuous
at times, which caused additional damage to a few structures. The line of thunderstorms produced widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain acrosEVENT NARRATIVE: Personal weather station reported a 58 mph wind gust in Laredo.",813423

Temperatures approached 90 degrees during the afternoon, with dew points as high as 80.  This resulted in a very unstable airmass across the area.  A trough of low pressure moved east into the western Great Lakes by late morning, and thunderstorms ignited along the trough.  These storms moved southeast into Michigan, and a large number of them became severe.

The first severe report was dime sized hail in southwest Midland County.  That would be the only severe hail event; the rest of the day was filled with damaging wind gusts.  A 66 mph gust was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a spotter estimated 70 mph winds near downtown Detroit.

Most the damage caused by the wind involved downed trees and power lines.  Trees were downed onto homes in the city of Midland, White Lake, Lake Orion, Pontiac, and Deerfield Township (Lapeer County).  Deerfield Township was especially hard hit, as some roads were closed for several days due to tree debris. A number of tents at the Ann Arbor Art Fair were demolished.  Vehicles were destroyed in White Lake and Port Huron when trees fell on them.  A large awning was blown off the roof of a Canton strip mall, and the roof of a hangar at the Oakland County International Airport in Waterford was displaced by the wind.  Panelling was torn off the press box at Tiger Stadium in Detroit.  In St Clair Shores, a garage collapsed, moored sailboats were tipped over, and part of an aluminum roof was peeled off a warehouse.

Locally heavy rainfall occurred with some of the thunderstorms, especially in metro Detroit.  Freeway underpasses were flooded in Detroit, as were fifty basements in Dearborn.  The thunderstorm hazard resulted in over a hundred flights at Detroit Metropolitan Airport being either delayed or cancelled.  The Reform Party national convention in Dearborn was seriously disrupted, as several scheduled speakers - including Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura - could not fly into Detroit.

This severe weather outbreak primarily targeted western and northeast portions of the area, largely sparing locations south of the Highway 6 corridor between Holdrege and Geneva. The final tornado breakdown per the EF Scale included two EF3, four EF2, two EF1 and three EF0. Despite considerable damage to mainly rural residences, these tornadoes resulted in no fatalities and only one known non-life threatening injury when a semi truck was tipped over near Elm Creek in Buffalo County. This Elm Creek tornado was also the only one to directly strike a community, although there were several close calls within a mile or two of places such as Amherst, Hampton and Bradshaw. Interestingly, tornadic storms also spared the immediate Tri-Cities population centers of Grand Island, Hastings and Kearney, despite damaging events occurring nearby to both the west and the east. This was largely due to the fact that an expansive mid-level dry intrusion became anchored over central sections of South Central Nebraska, protecting this area from storm development. In addition to tornadoes, the afternoon also featured several reports of large hail up to baseball size, and damaging winds up to 80 MPH. 

This outbreak focused between 3 and 8 PM CDT, as a seasonably powerful mid-level low pressure system lifted into western Kansas and Nebraska out of Colorado, deepening and closing off as it did so. Strong wind fields aloft were in place at all levels, with a 50-70 knot jet streak nosing into the region between the 500 and 300 millibar level, and an 850-millibar low-level jet accelerating to between 30 and 40 knots. At the surface, a well-defined 992-millibar low pressure center migrated from north central Kansas around the noon hour, to near Hastings by early evening.

The event was the result of subtropical moisture rapidly overrunning a dome of cold air, causing a period of moderate snow and sleet.  A secondary wave of low pressure developed along the North Carolina coast, locking the low-level cold air in place over inland locations.

Precipitation had an immediate impact on the morning commute, causing numerous fender-benders and a several more serious accidents in the metropolitan area.  One of the more notable accidents occurred in Southeast, where a 10-car pileup was noted on the 11th Street bridge.  

The changeover to mixed precipitation, combined with widespread road treatments, allowed for a more benign evening commute.  Residential roads remained treacherous until the following day, when afternoon temperatures rose well above freezing.

The forest fires in Colorado were a contributing factor to the thunderstorm initiation.  During the night of the 11th and early morning of the 12th, two mesoscale convective systems formed over the fires in Colorado and tracked across Kansas.  By sunrise on the 12th, the outflow from one of the complexes pushed north into northern Kansas and Southern Nebraska to interact with a quasi-stationary frontal boundary.  Thunderstorms developed in this area and began to track east along the frontal boundary.  The airmass near the front was quiet unstable with dew point temperatures in the low to mid 70s.  During the day, some clearing allowed for heating to take place.  Once surface temperatures reach 27 C. there the negative inhibition was gone and surface based thunderstorms began to form.  Meanwhile, a large and unseasonably strong upper low began to drop southeast into the north central U.S. and interacted with the developing storms.  Thunderstorms formed in two rounds.  The first round rolled across the state during the mid afternoon hours into the early evening.  Another cluster of storms formed in the wake of the first by mid evening.  For the most part, severe weather from the storms was in the form of hail.  There were numerous reports of nickle to quarter size hail.  Nearly all of the storms produced up to marble size hail.  High winds were reported with one of the storms in Taylor County.  The winds tore the roofs of of barns in the area south of Siam.  Wind damage was also reported southwest of Bedford with trees blown over.  Crops were damaged by hail in many areas.  Widespread crop damage occurred in Taylor County south of Siam due to the combination of winds and hail.  The storms produced very heavy rainfall in many areas.  Flash flooding took place in southern Polk County, especially in Des Moines and areas east and south.  Rainfall rates were in the 2 to 3 inch per hour range.  The city of Des Moines was hard hit with flooded streets.  There were numerous reports of stalled vehicles with water two to three feet deep in the streets.  East of Des Moines in the Runnells area, low lying gravel roads between Runnells and highway 163 were barricaded as they went under water.  Damage occurred to some of the county gravel roads as well as numerous houses by basement flooding.  Flash flooding also occurred in Dallas County.

In excess of 6000 structures will require roof, window, and siding repairs.  In some cases, hail stones penetrated the shingles, sheeting, and interior ceiling drywall.  One person reported an 8 inch diameter hole in their roof.  Another home owner sustained $60,000 in damage.  One more home owner reported hail stones landing on the living room couch, after falling through the roof.  Over 3000 automobiles were severely damaged. One local auto dealership experienced damage to 297 cars on the lot.  Hundreds of windows were lost on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Kearney.  Eight police cruisers were damaged.  Fifteen (15) people were treated for minor abrasions and released from the local hospital.  Several hailstones measured 5 inches in diameter throughout the county, and there were unconfirmed reports of melon sized hail near Amherst.

In Kearney county, extensive damage was noted in the Minden area.  Four and a half (4.5) inch diameter hail was reported in the city.  The most extensive damage occurred at the indoor greenhouse facility which grows tomatoes.  The glass structure was no match for the softball size hailstones.  2500 pains of glass were broken, including about 60 percent of the roof panes.  Shards of glass penetrated the tomatoes and forced the expulsion of the product for safety reasons.  Crop damage was widespread throughout the county as over 22,000 acres of corn, soybeans and alfalfa were severely damaged or destroyed.

A F1 (Fujita Scale) tornado touched down in the Brandywine Village/Lafayette Park area of Upper Merion Township on Allendale Road just to the north of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 276).  The tornado sighting was phoned into the National Weather Service by a SKYWARN Spotter.  The tornado stayed on the ground for about one mile before lifting around Crossfield Road.  Most of the wind damage was downed or snapped (40 to 50) trees.  The bulk of the uprooted trees were either in poor health or very old.  Two houses were damaged by trees falling on them.  The worse one sustained about $6,000 in damage to its roof, porch, upstairs bathroom and gutters.  The tornado touched down within one mile of the King of Prussia Mall.  No injuries were reported.  This was the 12th confirmed tornado in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area this year. 
Elsewhere in Montgomery County damaging winds knocked over a centerfield fence and uprooted between 12 and 18 trees in Upper Gwynedd Township.  A lightning strike ignited a fire in an Upper Gwynedd house.  It apparently entered through the electrical box and started a fire in the basement.  Damage was estimated between $25,000 and $30,000.  Thunderstorm winds uprooted a large pear tree in Audubon.  Frequent lightning resulted in power outages to 55,000 Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) customers throughout their service area.

Trees and wires were blown down in Cooperstown and northern Burlington Flats between 3:30 and 3:40 pm EDT.  Several roads were blocked due to the downed trees and wires.  People were trapped in their vehicles by falling trees and some sustained injury from flying debris, broken glass, or falling wires.




     An intensifying storm system moved across upstate New York and into southern Quebec early in the morning on the 31st.  This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.  
     From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.
     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.
     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.

Summary of events of June 16, 1997:

Severe thunderstorms developed and moved across much of Oklahoma during the afternoon and evening of the 16th.  Numerous reports of large hail, damaging thunderstorm winds, and flash flooding were received from across the region.  

The largest hail fell east of Seminole in Seminole County, where grapefruit-sized hail was reported. Elsewhere, a combination of strong winds and hail as large as golf balls caused extensive damage in Tonkawa in Kay County and across much of Grant County.

The strongest estimated wind speed during the event was 80 mph in Comanche in Stephens County, which suffered widespread tree, limb, and structural damage.  Other major structural damage was reported in Kingston in Marshall County, northeast of Eldorado and in Altus in Jackson County, northwest of Hydro in Blaine County, in Seminole in Seminole County, and in Duncan in Stephens County.  More minor damage, mainly to trees and utility poles, occurred in Sayre and Elk City in Beckham County, in Marietta in Love County, in Arapaho and west of Custer City in Custer County, in Mannsville in Johnston County, east of Holdenville in Hughes County, in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County, in Marlow in Stephens County, and in Wewoka in Seminole County.  

Flash flooding was particularly severe in Ponca City in Kay County, where several people were rescued from flooded vehicles and seven homes were flooded.  Flash flooding was also reported in Gerty in Hughes County and in and around Comanche in Stephens County.

This led to a broad diffluent pattern over most of the southeastern states. As the system approached the right rear quadrant of upper jet moved into the forecast area coincident with a low-level jet of, at least, 60 knots. This created atmospheric dynamics favorable for severe weather, with the only limiting factor being modest instability. A warm front over the area during the morning moved rapidly north in response to increasing southerly flow allowing a gradual increase in low level instability. By afternoon several severe weather events and three tornadoes occurred over portions of southeast Georgia.EVENT NARRATIVE: The tornado first touched down at approximately 1415EST in northwest Pierce County near Merson Road and Crump Road. Several trees were damaged and a farm shed had portions of its sheet metal roof removed. Winds here were estimated to have been near 70 mph or EF-0. The tornado moved northeast across several fields and encountered two small farm structures and a wooded area along Tiny Lane.

The moisture was in limited supply with this event.  A cold front approached the state from the northwest.  This front moved into the state during the late afternoon and evening of the 16th.  Moisture was limited with this system.  Surface dew points were in the mid 50s to around 60 during the early part of the afternoon over the southeast half of the state.  The moisture was very shallow.  Afternoon mixing lowered dew points into the upper 40s over the southeast, and into the upper 20s and 30s over the northwest just ahead of the front.  Temperatures warmed into mid 80s to low 90s which made the airmass quite unstable.  CAPE values were around 1000 J/kg with Lifted Indices around -4 C. just ahead of the front.  Convection had a hard time getting organized at first with only spotty cells forming ahead of the front.  By early evening, a small MCS formed over western Iowa and advanced east-southeast across the state.  The MCS produced hail in many locations along with gusty winds.  In spite of the ""inverted V"" type upper air soundings, high winds were not as widespread as would normally be expected.  Several locations did report gusts to around 60 MPH.  High winds blew a car off of Interstate 80 in Poweshiek County southeast of Malcom.  A wind gust of 70 MPH was reported at the Ames Airport in Story County.  For the most part, the hail was in the three quarter to one inch diameter size.  Hail did cover the ground in Carroll County at Lidderdale.  The largest hail report came from Guthrie County north of Panora into the Panora area.  Golf ball size hail was reported at that location.

Heavy rain fell across portions of north Texas during the first part of November.  These rains served as the precursor of a very wet month over the region.  On the 2nd and 3rd rains were confined mainly to the southern and eastern portions of the area from near Hamilton, to Palestine, to Sulphur springs.

Widespread moderate to heavy rainfall occurred across north Texas on the 5th as a slow moving front progressed across the area.  Numerous reports of flash flooding were received as the rain caused various degrees of damage over the area.

Damage was extensive and no county in the state was spared some effect of the storm.  Damage was the greatest in the eastern counties with damage decreasing from east-to-west across the state.   Damage also decreased as you went north in the state.  Damage varied  with many trees, signs, and power lines downed.  At the worst, 2.6 million people in Alabama were without electricity, some for over a week.  The center of the storm entered the state near the Covington/Escambia County line on the Florida border.  It moved north-northeast with the center moving just west of the city of Montgomery, near the City of Talladega, and near Fort Payne before exiting the state near the northeast tip. Primary damage came from strong wind which toppled trees and power lines and damaged signs.  Mobile homes were damage both by falling trees and by strong wind.  Wind speeds varied across the state.

However, during the first week of the month the wet pattern of June did continue.  The heaviest rainfall occurred over west central Iowa with Atlantic picking up 5.07 inches of rain on the 5th.  Surprisingly, the East Fork of the Nishnabotna River at Atlantic did not reach flood state from these rains.  Rainfall from this system in the Raccoon River basin amounted to two to four niches, causing another significant rise on both the North and South branches of the Raccoon, and eventually downstream on the mainstem river.  The crest at Van Meter was 18.83 feet on the 7th, quite respectable for an annual peak in most years, but almost 4.5 feet below the crest that occurred in June of 1998.  Southwest 18th Street in Des Moines on the Raccoon River crested 14 hours later at 16.51 feet on the 8th, nearly closing Fleur Drive, a major artery into downtown Des Moines.  Flood stages were also reached on numerous smaller tributaries in the Des Moines basin from this storm.  Damage was relatively minor from this event.  The rest of the month was relatively dry with no further flooding recorded.",320193

EPISODE NARRATIVE: An outbreak of severe weather impacted much of the central U.S. from Minnesota to Texas during the late afternoon and evening hours of the 21st. The west Texas South Plains and the extreme southern Texas Panhandle were affected by a series of significant tornadoes. At least five tornadoes were spawned by a single cyclic supercell thunderstorm that resulted in more than $3.5 million in damages.
The most severely impacted communities included Olton (Lamb County) and Tulia (Swisher County). Both of these west Texas towns were impacted by EF-2 tornadoes that destroyed property and injured four people, and more than 14,000 customers were without electrical power throughout the night.
The tornado outbreak was caused by a potent storm system that progressed east over the Four Corners region of the western U.S. on the 21st. A potent upper level jet stream spread over the Southern Plains of the U.S., and helped to create a favorable environment for supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes along a dryline that was stretched across west Texas.",682319

Colder air was drawn into the area in the wake of the boundary, changing the ongoing rain to mixed precipitation, freezing rain and sleet, then to snow. The period of mixed precipitation only lasted a couple hours, except for across a portion of the Capital District, western Albany, southern Saratoga and Rensselaer counties, where a prolonged period of mostly sleet occurred. 

Heavy snow accumulated across the western Adirondacks,  Mohawk and Schoharie Valleys, the central and eastern Catskills, the Lake George Saratoga region, and across the Capital District. One to 2 feet of snow was reported across the southern Adirondacks and Mohawk Valley, 8 to 18 inches across the Lake George Saratoga region, Helderbergs, and Schoharie Valley, with 5 to 8 inches of snow and sleet across the Capital District on top of the quarter to about a half of an inch of ice accretion.  

Across portions of the southern Taconics, mainly above 500 feet, pockets of freezing rain led to significant ice accretion of up to one inch. This led to downed trees, power lines and power poles, and resulted in power outages. The Towns of Amenia, Northeast, and a portion of Dover were hardest hit by the ice.

The snow came down heavy at times, with snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour. In addition, brisk northerly winds resulted in blowing and drifting of the snow during the morning hours. This combination of heavy snow, along with blowing and drifting of the snow made it difficult for snow plows to clear the roads.
